      <p>It was a down week in my <a href="http://www.trailrunevents.com/ul
/schedule-50k.asp" title="UltraLadies 50K Training Plan">training schedule</a> for the <a href="http://www2.thenorthface.com/endurancechallenge/races/2010/dc/index.html">Mid-Atlantic
Regional North Face Endurance Challenge
50K</a>.
On June 5th I will have 9 hours to complete the ~31 mile course.</p>

<p>Saturday was a good 12 mile run with Mandy and Cherry from Great Falls to
Algonkian Park on the <a href="http://www.potomactrail.org/">Potomac Heritage Trail</a>
which makes up or at least parallels a fair amount of TNFEC DC route. The
weather was beautiful if slightly chilly and a little windy. We finished
faster than I had previously done that section ~2:30. I didn't feel at all bad
letting them head back to and around Great Falls for another 14 or so miles.
This was the first time out with the Nathan vest and I have to say I like it.
Sunday was the <a href="http://www.lcsj.org/">Loudoun Abused Women's Shelter (LAWS)</a>
<a href="http://www.runfortheshelter.org/">Half Marathon</a>. I had planned to go out
easy, continue on and finish that way, a nice easy supported training run.
Having reviewed my results from my first running of the event in 2009 I knew
that I needed to beat a 10:15/mi pace to PR and decided to see how I felt in
the morning after an early start, trip to Columbia and a Caps game in DC and
late celebration at the Irish Channel for the Caps second game against the
Habs the day before.</p>

<p>Race day, it was cold when I woke up at 6 after about 4 hours of sleep. I had
pre-mixed fuel in my new <a href="http://www.nathansports.com/our-
products/hydrationnutrition/race-vests/hpl-020">Nathan HPL 020</a> with its
<a href="http://www.hydrapak.com/">HydraPak</a> bladder to replace my older leaking
CamelBak with its taped patches, pinned on my number, attached my timing chip,
laid out my clothes and set the coffee maker to start brewing at 5:50. I
rolled out of the house about 7:15 and arrived in the parking lot around 7:30.
I mustered the will to get out of the car and into the cold wander into the
hall, chat with Conan and eventually back out for a lack luster warmup only to
find that my Garmin would not turn on even though I took it off the charger
right before I left the house. Oh well, I have RunKeeper which works well
enough if my phone can get GPS signals.</p>

<p>At almost exactly not quite 8:30 the race started after an abysmally down
tempo rendition of the National Anthem. In the first half mile I felt horrible
and thought to myself that if I hadn't crossed the starting line I could just
quit. It's one thing to not start but another thing entirely to DNF and I
wasn't going to start doing that now. At mile 1 I got the first and only split
until after the turn around. 00:11:49 eh, I thought so much for a PR. Got to
the first water at about 1.25mi skipped it but took a drink from the pack and
a walk to adjust the shock cord on the Nathan, it was managing to brush me
right on the funny bone every so often.</p>

<p>Around mile 3 I loosened up and started enjoying the race, around 4.5 the
leaders on the road started passing on the return leg. Then I had to stop and
urinate the second of three times during the race, I guess that is a good sign
for getting re-hydrated after Saturday but it seemed ridiculous. I started
passing some people who had gone by in the first three miles but still took it
easy with no real idea of pace or HR. A few times I noticed that my breathing
was a bit labored and backed off to easy again reducing pace on inclines and
just going with the flow.</p>

<p>At mile 7 the second split on the course I got ~1:11:30 and realized that even
with the horrible beginning, a bit of walking and running easy I was close
enough that the ~10:14 I would need to make a PR was in reach if I kept it up
and maybe pushed a little on the down hills (forgetting that the return really
seems like it is mostly long slow climbs). I rolled on with renewed
enthusiasm. From 7 - 12.1 my split was ~2:01:?? and I thought, holy crap I
just flew through those miles like nothing, even with another pit stop all I
needed was nice fairly easy 10:00/mi to be sure of a good PR. A short sprint
up the last little hill and across the line left me with a new Half Marathon
PR of 2:10:37 down from 2:14:17 in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment thoughts</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nathansports.com/our-products/hydrationnutrition
/race-vests/hpl-020">Nathan HPL 020</a></p>

<p><em>The Good:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>No bottles (as with the FuelBelt) to hit with my thighs on obstacles</li>
  <li>Front facing pockets are great and totally missing from my CamelBak packs primarily used for cycling.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/perpetuem.pp.html">Hammer Perpetum</a> in the reversible bladder (for cleaning) works well, no problems with flow.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The only OK:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The bite valve, when the bladder is full and I am running the valve drips/squirts a little as fluid sloshes. I find myself turning the flow on and off via the push pull mechanism which I think adversely affects my ability to sip as frequently as I did with the CamelBak.</em></li>
  <li><em>Bite valve on/off the push pull mechanism, it works but it isn't my favorite.</em></li>
  <li><em>Having recently been shopping for hiking packsâ€¦I would really like the strap adjustments to pull towards the back (your front) so that I could snug the pack on the run. Again thinking that I could slightly modify the fit as content and volume change.</em></li>
  <li><em>I had snugged the shock cord on the back of the pack to see how it affected the fairly minimal sloshing I had noticed. It didn't seem to make a difference but the now longer end of the cord swung to gently tap me on the funny bone every so often.</em></li>
  <li><em>The closed zip pocket on the front has the same mesh back, if I were to store a phone/camera in the pocket I would need to continue to use a bag inside the pocket.</em></li>
</ul>
