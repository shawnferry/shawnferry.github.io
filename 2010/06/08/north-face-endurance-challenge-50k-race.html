      <p>It was my first
<a href="http://www2.thenorthface.com/endurancechallenge/races/2010/dc/index.html">50k</a>
and I finished!<br />
I went into the race with a hydration plan and no real idea when/if I would
finish. I knew my training was mostly solid I wasn't trying anything new it
was going to be hot and humid. In training particularly on trails I found that
I was overestimating how much I was drinking. With a solution in hand and
regrets that I might be heartily annoying to those around me I wore a timex
with two 10 minute interval timers set.<br />
<strong>The Plan</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I would run at some comfortable/reasonable pace that kept my HR down on the flats. Walk uphills and go quickly with control on the downhills.</li>
  <li>10min I would drink ~4-5oz <a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/">Hammer</a> <a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/perpetuem.pp.html?navcat=fuels-energy-drinks">Perpetum</a> mixed to ~250/cal 25oz</li>
  <li>30min I would take 1 possibly 2 Hammer <a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/endurolytes.elt.html?navcat=fuels-energy-drinks">Endurolyte</a> capsules</li>
  <li>60 min I would take an 1 maybe 2 Hammer <a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/endurance-amino.ea.html">Endurance Amino</a> capsules</li>
  <li>As needed/desired I would take Hammer Gel, Cliff Shot Bloks or some Hammer Bar. The Hammer bar as a last resort as I hadn't trained with them.</li>
  <li>Aid 2/4 (Great Falls) and Aid 5 (Frasier) would get longer stops to mix fuel. Everything else would get a gulp of water.</li>
  <li>At the finish I would mix a double strength <a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/recoverite.rr.html?navcat=recovery">Recoverite</a> drink about half relatively quickly and nurse the rest for a little while</li>
</ul>

<p>It is about 5 minutes to 7:00, humidity is high, the temps are in the high 70s
only going up. We would never look quite so fresh the rest of the day. At the
start of the race I took off at a quite comfortable ~10:30/mi. The first
couple of miles are flat grass, golf cart path and crushed gravel road. I ran
with Matt Lancaster from around 2.5 - 5.7 and we talked about his tips for
ultras. I breezed through Aid 1 (5.7), as planned, slowing only to check in
and for a cup of water. About 2 miles before Aid 2 I heard "why was there no
water (at River Bend Park)?" "Does anyone know how much further until the next
aid station?"<br />
<a href="http://lalartu.smugmug.com/Running

June-2010/SPF20100605IMG3992/893509647_KKY5w-S.jpg" alt="" /></a> At Aid 2 (12.4) Great Falls I was feeling pretty good. However, was
already concerned about hydration. I was hot and had started to get goosebumps
around 11 miles and <em>had</em> been drinking on plan. On arrival I had ~5oz
remaining in the pack having used up almost all of my reserve placing me ~2oz
shy of 25oz/hr. It was at this time that I started icing everything ice hat,
ice pocket, ice in the bladder and pack. Remixing was mostly painless but
60-65oz instead of the planned 50oz, this would be a theme for the rest of the
race with my fuel tasting a bit thin. Dee and Ron rolled out and I decided to
pause and change socks I had been thinking about saving them for the return
leg but my feet were swimming.<br />
Total Consumption ~65+oz<br />
From Aid 2 (Great Falls) back to Aid 4 (19.27, Great Falls) I caught up to
Matt who had passed me in on his way through. He told me that he was feeling a
bit dry and that he was going to take the loop easy to see if he could
recover. In Great Falls my pace dropped dramatically. My feet already soaked
again and were sliding a bit in my shoes. I didn't want them any tighter but
my big toes were slamming the front of the toe box on the steeper descents.
Partway through the loop everything started to sound distant (which continued
for the next 5 hours or so,  about an hour after the race the pressure in my
ears normalized) and look a bit grey which seems odd as my HR was not
abnormally elevated, it may have just been hazy. I backed off a bit more and
tried hydrating at a slightly higher rate concerned that I was heading towards
major problems. Matt came into Aid 3 (15.08) as I was leaving (with another
ice hat!). The swamp trail wasn't fun at all, the rocky terrain had my feet at
all angles and sliding again. Just off the swamp trail I caught up with Ron
who indicated that he was feeling cooked and might drop at mile 20. At Aid 4 I
paused to mix more fuel finding ~10oz and C- got me an ice rag for my neck.<br />
Total Consumption ~115+oz<br />
From Aid 4 - Aid 5 (26) I was struggling with a bit of nausea every 10 minutes
I would drink then feel a little nauseous, if I tried to push the pace I got
goose bumps and felt off. My hill climbing walks slowed substantially and my
flats were walked as much as run. In River Bend Park I met Bob and Beth who
had adopted each other as race partners encouraging people along the way. We
chatted in a group ranging in size from 3-10 as we walked the uphills, ran the
downhills and ran on and off on the flats. After a few miles I stopped to get
a rock out of my shoe and lost them until Aid 5. About a mile from Aid 5 I
stopped to try and get a Marathon runner who was staggering and clearly
disoriented heading the right direction. He was non-coperative and I asked a
group of passing 50mi runners to send back help as they would reach aid before
I did. Not long after aid was tearing down the path with a gallon of water.<br />
Total consumption ~160+oz<br />
Aid 5 - Aid 6 (29.28) Aside from a few steep climbs this section is mostly
flat fun and fast until you get to the golf course when it is sort of boring.
Unfortunately I was not feeling particularly fast but I picked up a ridiculous
run/walk from blaze to blaze that sometimes had me running/walking only a
dozen or so steps at a time and my average speed picked back up to slightly
faster than a snails pace. I entered Aid 6 with Bob, Beth, Carol and the guy
with a camelback but apparently not the hydration part. Had a couple cups of
water, more ice hat and dumped ice down the back of my shirt.<br />
Aid 6 - Finish (My Garmin says 32.2) The last officially 1.7 miles are flat on
gravel, golf cart path and a touch of grass. After each aid station I felt
refreshed with ice in my hat, pockets, pack and actually maintained a quickish
(sort of) pace and ran in the last .5 with a ridiculous grin on my face at
08:19:04 â€¦ I had a good 40 minutes to spare.<br />
Total consumption ~210+oz<br />
<a href="http://lalartu.smugmug.com/Running

June-2010/SPF20100605IMG3999/893511832_EMZpB-M.jpg" alt="" /></a>Post race, cheered Bob and Beth through the finish. Hit the ice bath,
the pain was exquisite, for about 60s before I got out. Got a massage drank
about 80oz of Recoverite and water and had a burrito before heading home
chilling out and heading across the street for a margarita party.<br />
The Good:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The next day I felt fine (I slept until 1pm but I didn't get back from the party until 1am)</li>
  <li>Three days later and I feel great and mostly normal (compared to my first marathon, it took over a week)</li>
  <li>No major injuries, a couple of small blisters and sore but recovered big toe nails</li>
  <li>I am ready for the next one (Theoretically, not actually)</li>
  <li>No cramping</li>
  <li>No swelling</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nathansports.com/our-products/hydrationnutrition/race-vests/hpl-020">Nathan HPL #20</a> with replacement <a href="http://www.hydrapak.com/technology/reservoir-tech">HydraPak</a> bite valve and magnetic clip</li>
  <li><a href="http://store.haloheadband.com/SPORT_HATS_s/22.htm">Halo Hat</a>, I like halo hats/headbands etc.</li>
  <li>Hammer Tri top/bottom. No chafing fast wicking</li>
  <li>Perpetum added dry to a partially full bladder mixes up just fine with a <a href="http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/blender-bottle-0174-.bwb.html?navcat=accessories&amp;subnavcat=bottles">blender ball</a> (in testing also without a blender ball but not as fast).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Could have been Better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I should have started icing at Aid 1</li>
  <li>I should have mixed my fuel stronger and added ice just before the start</li>
  <li>Maybe I should have changed shoes at Aid 2 and damn the rocks</li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/sc-gear/mens-footwear-filter-category-running/mens-devils-thumb-gtx-xcr.html" title="The North Face Men's Devils Thumb">Gore-Tex shoes</a> sounded like such a good idea in the winter when it was wet and I started training</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They are a bit hot now and don't dry so quickly</li>
      <li>I think I want something cooler, lighter and much faster drying</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe I should have mixed stronger fuel or eaten (a little) more on the run</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I didn't feel like a bonk was coming I just trained with a higher concentration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hydration, Maybe ~13lbs in 8 hours is normal but that is roughly 5.9% dehydration</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maybe I should have gone with a slightly higher intake rate the whole race</li>
      <li>Maybe it was too high late, my math says close to 27oz/hr</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I need to adjust my hat for pictures, Ice Hat is awesome but it doesn't look as nice</li>
  <li>Light nausea after drinking lasting a minute or two (too much fluid?)</li>
  <li>Holy crap the music was loud in the finish area. Too loud to talk so we went home.</li>
  <li>Late Discoveries*
    <ul>
      <li>Blister under the nail of my left big toe. Which explains why descending was so painful</li>
      <li>A couple of small spots of poison ivy around my ankles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People started without any way to carry water</li>
  <li>The distance from Aid 1-2/4-5 was theoretically 6.7 miles I got a little longer. People with water were having problems running out.</li>
  <li>It was hot and humid, more than I had trained in more than I was ready for.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I am very happy with the race itself, my performance and the
experience in general. I am thankful to C- who would much rather have been
staining her new bookshelves or sewing rather than sitting around waiting for
me all day and taking pictures. The next one will be better.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Edit: Newly discovered injuries/ailments</li>
</ul>
