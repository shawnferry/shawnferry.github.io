Richard Elling

Performability = Ability to Perform  

Simple: when up performance = 100, down = 0

This is not an accurate(realistic,real life) representation of system
performance and availability for complex systems..

This is something that Sun Managed Operations has been dealing with for years.
Say you have 100 identical web servers, if 10 are down what state are you in.

This is even harder in complex environments. All of managed ops PSEs should
attend this presentation, it isn't something that we all deal with, but as
trusted solution providers/advisers this is right up our alley. Everything is
done in tradeoffs.
