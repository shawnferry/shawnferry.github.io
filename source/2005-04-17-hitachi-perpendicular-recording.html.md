This is interesting, and potentially useful to me... I need more storage  
in my laptop. And I wouldn't complain if I could get 1,400 exposures on a  
card... until I had to post process them, or if I toasted the physical  
card at any point. Ok, 20GB on a 1" microdrive, RAID 1 in camera. This  
animation is quite entertaining: [![Perpendicular
