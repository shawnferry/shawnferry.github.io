A question about using a powerbook as a serial console was forwarded  
around recently. I thought I would share my solution(which happened to be  
suggested by more than one person).  
  
I have been using a "Keyspan High Speed USB Serial  
Adapter":http://www.keyspan.com/products/usb/usa19hs/ a db9 -&gt; RJ45  
adapter, a rollover cable and
[ckermit](http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html)  
  
This solution has worked without a hitch for devices with RJ45 serial  
management ports. Adding a additional RJ45 to DB9 and RJ45 to DB25  
rounds out the connectors for basically everything else.  

Another recommendation from someone using the same hardware is
[Zterm](http://homepage.mac.com/dalverson/zterm/).

And now off to sleep.
