@Cdash is off in Sacramento in the middle of a cage migration and new hardware
deployment. I decided that it was finally time to make some of the tuna that I
bought a couple of months ago. I had planned to make it last night but didn't
get the meat into the fridge to thaw with enough time to spare.

This is based on [Seared Ahi Tuna
Recipe](http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/001681seared_ahi_tuna.php), I
deviated using the ingredients on hand. Starting with a very hot cast iron
skillet (smoking the oil) I seared the tuna for 70s a side.

After it was removed from the heat I sliced it into ~1/4 inch pieces and
plated it on a bit of spring mix for color.

It was excellent and it is a shame that my wife couldn't be here to have any.
I hope the migration is going well.
