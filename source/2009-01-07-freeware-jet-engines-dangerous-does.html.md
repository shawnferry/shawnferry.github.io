In a recent NY Times article on the R data analysis language Anne H. Milley
implied that her personal happiness stems from quality of jet engines that can
only be achieved through the use of commercial software.

If I were in Ms. Milley's position I too would be happy if people were paying
to use my product. What does not particularly matter to me is the cost of
software which is used to design those engines. What I truly care about is the
quality of the engineering, construction and validation procedures. In any
case as a passenger I am unsure how I can determine if the equipment I am
flying on was designed using free software or not. I will have to settle for
being happy if my flight is on time, security lines are short and I get home
to see my wife.

> “I think it addresses a niche market for high-end data analysts that want
free, readily available code," said Anne H. Milley, director of technology
product marketing at SAS. She adds, “We have customers who build engines for
aircraft. I am happy they are not using freeware when I get on a jet.”

NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-
computing/07program.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&th&emc=th)]

Given the implication that happiness, value and quality are only available for
products designed using commercial software; I find myself retroactively
saddened by all of the things that I have seen which were designed before
commercial software packages were available. I would like to thank Ms. Milley
for sucking the joy out of my life.
