The Marathon will have live results including split times somewhere on the
[Baltimore Marathon Site](http://www.thebaltimoremarathon.com/Home_Page.htm)
or at
[Active.com](http://results.active.com/pages/page.jsp?eventLinkageID=16773). I
don't know for sure and I won't be checking from the course.  
  
For all of you that follow me on twitter, you are obviously waiting for
updates with baited breath, I haven't had the time to work out a way to update
that I am sure won't end up as spam.  
Instamapper is showing you the last time I had GPS Tracker running, when I ran
20 miles of the course in baltimore, but will update as soon as I start it
back up on Saturday.

I will be wearing bib number Shawn (1117), my sisters Emily (21796) and Karina
(31683) will both be running the Baltimore Half Marathon. I also run with a
[Garmin 305](https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&pID=349), after the
race I will have detailed track information which I view with [Ascent from
Montebello Software](http://www.montebellosoftware.com/). Ascent allows me to
view my pace, heart rate and supporting data with a replay function to view
recorded data with a map overlay.  
After the race I will upload the recorded course to mapmyrun.com
