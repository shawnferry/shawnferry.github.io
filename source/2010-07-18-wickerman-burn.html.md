This year was my second Wickerman, it was different from the first in a number
of ways. Still a great time but the change in date for the event caused it to
overlap with both the [Baltimore 10
Miler](http://shawnferry.blogspot.com/2010/06/baltimore-10-miler-race-
report.html) and the [Twilight 4 Miler](http://www.twilightfourmiler.com/). I
left site very early Saturday to go to the race after arriving late on Friday.
As a result I was a bit tired Saturday during the day and evening.

I enjoyed the fire conclave and the burn again this year but the brief bit of
wind, rain and thunder drove much of the crowd away shortly after the man
fell. After the burn we headed to sound town but still called it a night a bit
earlier than watching the sun rise last year.
