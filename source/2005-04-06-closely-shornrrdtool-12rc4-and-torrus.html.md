1.2rc4 installed... Lack of font in display fixed, check recompile after  
compiling in non-global zon, done (Ah! that is why I didn‚Äot have  
/usr/ccs/bin in my path) drive bogus load to servers, running I have a  
make clean, sh config.status, nice -n 5 make loop running for 1.2rc4 to  
drive artificial load on the server, as well as a bunch of windows open  
pulling down pages from torrus every five minutes. I also have a find loop  
running on the little Solaris 10 laptop. Now I need to get around to  
rebuilding both the laptop and my firewall to at least GA...or maybe I  
will look into Nevada for one. Maybe tomorrow/today I will publish the  
link to the my Torrus install to let people poke around. I should check  
and see if the http collector works for apache2 first and update it it  
doesn't. More yaks to shave.
