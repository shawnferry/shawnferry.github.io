The secret to weight loss (aside from better eating habits and more exercise)
is telling people that you have a goal, it helps you stick to it. Actually
those are all the secrets for weight loss. I find that the secret for getting
my ass out of the house to get exercise is to train for races. If I don't have
a race it is easy to make excuses. I'm tired, it's raining or I'd rather just
drink some beer and read a book or watch TV. Following the weight loss formula
I'm publishing the races that I have selected for the year.  

  * April 4th -- [LAWS Half Marathon](http://www.runfortheshelter.org/) **Results:** 2:10:37 (PR)
  * May 2nd -- [ToughMudder Bear Creek](http://toughmudder.com/events/bear-creek/bear-creek-map/) (~7 miles on Ski slopes with obstacles) **Results:** Finished
  * May 23rd -- [MD Half Marathon](http://mdhalfmarathon.com/Page.aspx?pid=418)** Results:** 2:02:58 (PR) 
  * June 5th -- [The North Face Endurance Challenge Mid-Atlantic (50K)](http://www2.thenorthface.com/endurancechallenge/races/2010/dc/index.html)* **Results**: 08:19:04 (PR It is always a PR the first time you finish)
  * June 19th -- [Baltimore 10 Miler](http://www.baltimoretenmiler.com/site9.aspx)
  * June 19th -- [Twilight 4 Miler](http://www.twilightfourmiler.com/)

On that note, I'm going for a run.  
* Goal Race, and One of Baltimore or Marine Corps  
** Maybe, We'll see how the shorter ultra goes before getting really crazy and thinking about submitting an application  
  
Edit: I think I got the date for the 4 miler from last year, I am heavily
overbooked for the 19th
