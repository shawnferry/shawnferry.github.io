Unfortunately YakShaving appears to fit in quite well with thoughts of  
"Itcy and Scratchy" Most of the other direct hits have to do with my next  
post, which not existing yet probably gets a special tense from the "Hitch  
Hiker's Guide to The Galaxy" This post will probably get some poor people  
who are looking for something useful or informative or both as well.
