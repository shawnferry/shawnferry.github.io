The Christian Science Monitor has  
an article discussing virtual classrooms in SecondLife.  
  
Some  
60 schools and universities have set up shop  
inside Second Life - most in the past year. They join a population that  
includes real-world business people, politicians, entertainers, and  
more than 800,000 other "residents" of the virtual world.

It is an interesting idea, and I am wondering if I am seeing all of  
these uses for SecondLife because I have been looking at/thinking about  
the Sun Press Conference or if there has suddenly been an explosion of  
articles and posts about SecondLife.

For the past two years, I had been taking classes to complete my a  
Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. I have finished all of  
my upper division classes but have about a traditional semester worth  
of lower division classes that I never completed the first time through  
in traditional schooling.  
  
At the moment I am not taking any classes and the dividing point  
between the attendance and not was the continuing classes being located  
at a different campus, that and the cost at
href="http://www.phoenix.edu/">UOP was  
significantly higher than say [NOVA](http://www.nvcc.edu/),  
Classes started at 6 and ran until 10, that wasn't a problem.  
  
The problem was the

the campus at Plaza America (Reston, near Oracle), was a 30-60 minute  
drive. The

from the office to the Gallows Rd campus (495 and 50 near Fairfax  
Hospital)  is probably a 90 to 120 minute drive (This is all  
in traffic to get there the return commute is probably 20-30 and 45-50  
minutes). It goes almost without saying that the NVCC

is better, either to the Loudoun campus or to Reston (nearly identical  
to my previous UOP commute).  
  
Having said all of that it would have been interesting to see if a  
virtual learning solution based on SecondLife or a similar venue would  
have been useful. The commute is certainly shorter, but I have to  
wonder if the level of attention that would have been focused on the  
learning would have been the same given that it would be easier for  
coworkers and such to interrupt by casually walking into the room.  
  
It seems that only time will tell, but a good first taste of an  
organized information centric event will be on
href="http://blogs.sun.com/yakshaving/entry/secondlife_web2_0_and_collaboration">Tuesday  
at the Sun SecondLife Press Conference.  
  
Now I should go and sign up for classes as the next round starts on Oct  
18\. Should I be ashamed that I am looking at on the ground classes  
working for a technical company?
