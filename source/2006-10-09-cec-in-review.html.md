CEC2006: Too much content not enough time  
  
Next Year:  

  * [Kyocera KR1](http://www.evdoinfo.com/EVDO_Products/EVDO_Routers/Kyocera_KR1_EVDO_Router_with_WiFi_20050427264/)
    * It seems that the state of high density WiFi may be slightly less than carrier grade, at least for temporary third party installations
  * The good camera
    * Not that the Cannon Point and Shoot is bad, just that I found myself wanting the more easily adjustable manual settings of the D1x
  * The Managed Operations CEC blog/multi media Tiger Team (MOCECBMMTT? OK I made that up)

Interactivity(Web2.0):  

  * It was interesting, and hey I apparently won $200 for the most useful sms messages. I have yet to be contacted about my prize, maybe I should check my VM.
    * Other winners were for such things as the most entertaining SMS
    * Large (Ultra 20 and 24" monitors) prizes for best blog and such
      * Not that I am bitter but I would rather have the Ultra 20 than the $200
  * Much bemoaned by me, connectivity was a major issue
    * Although apparently it might have been problems with my laptop almost as much as anything else, at least when the people sitting next to me were able to get access while I was not.
  * Someone suggested brining the backend out to the front.
    * I think that would have been great, as Dan indicated...this is a technical conference after all
    * We should expose the technical aspects

Suggestions:  

  * LISA (USENIX) like content tracks 
    * Refereed papers: A collection of 3 or so papers in a similar vein for an hour each
    * Longer Presentation Slots (3 hours or so)
    * WIPs: Short topics presentation overviews, here is what we are doing
  * More accessable BOFs
    * Tables at lunch was a good idea
    * real BOF session availability would have been appreciated
    * Too busy trying to get food and eat too really spend time finding all the groups
  * Possibly longer, too much interesting information for the available time
    * Maybe it is just me, I would have attended maybe 75% of the presentations given time
  * A better scheduler
    * 355 possible sessions (including duplicates)
      * Presented in a list (depending on search criteria)
    * Pick by topic/presentation (Content Catalog) would have been more useful
      * Then given the list of desired presentations work on resolving conflicting selections
      * Allow alternate selections to be maintained, I didn't attend all of the presentations I selected
    * A capability to display only otherwise un-selected presentations for open time slots would also have been very useful
  * A better view into content
    * This would prefereably be the content catalog mentioned above
    * I ignored presentations because I didn't know what they were really about
    * It turns out that I would have liked to attend more and might have attended differently given better information
      * Although see above: not enough time...

CEC Posts in Review:  

I was going to collect links to categories and such or individual
bloggers/entries...too much work so instead

We have an internal survey on this year's CEC, I should go do that. If there
is one thing I am generally not lacking, it is opinions.
