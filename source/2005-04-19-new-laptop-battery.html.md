Received a new battery for my Ti Book today. So far, it is charged. I am  
supposed to wait 12 hours before going off line power then run it down  
until my laptop suspends. (This to try and calibrate the microprocessor in  
the battery) That part isn't a problem. What concerns me is that as with  
the old battery the charge went to ~75-80% and then jumped to 100%  
charged. The reverse was also happening with the old battery only it was  
jumping from ~35-40% to 0% Hopefully this will not be the case with the  
new battery. Although 2.5 years and still over an hour of full power use  
isn't too bad. We will see. If I continue to see strange behavior I will  
go for a PMU reset. Then off to the genius bar if I can show the problem  
with more than one battery maybe I will get somewhere without having to  
let them have my laptop for testing for a minimum of three days. Repair is  
one thing, but testing where I know that what they said they will do is  
watch it charge and discharge a number of times is just silly.  
Particularly when I can show logs of the charge discharge cycle.
