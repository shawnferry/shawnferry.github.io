It has been a long 16 weeks of training and progressing a bit faster than I
should to try and get on track with my [20 week 50k training plan from
UltraLadies](http://www.trailrunevents.com/ul/schedule-50k.asp "UltraLadies
50K Training Plan" ). I'm about as ready as I am capable of being. Nothing I
can do now to get ready except to stick to my taper. Which apparently for me
means running in the Cascades 10K and getting another PR*. All I need to do
now is finish The North Face Endurance Challenge 50k and that will make three
PRs in three weeks.

* It is always a PR the first time
