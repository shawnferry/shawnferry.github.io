Bob Sneed, of course it was absolutely as far as it could be from Capacity and
immediately after.

Upgrade to S10U4 now :) (this could almost be the whole message)

Performance issues are: perceived + industry + real (all three must be
addressed)

See b.s.c. timc "event driven utilization"

Application performance on Solaris 10 is NOT always better BUT can almost
always be made to work better under S10 than with previous versions of
Solaris.

2 presentations of 60 - 90 minutes done via speed reading

Upgrade to S10U4
