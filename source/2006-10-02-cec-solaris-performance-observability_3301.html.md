Solaris Performance, Observability and Debugging. Tools and methods for
drilling down and dazzling customers.  

Jim Mauro, was as usual quite entertaining and educational. The presentation
could have run for at least two hours.  

I don't have access to the internet again but I am reasonably sure that the
slides are available online.  

However in summary:  

pstack, dtrace, use your tools we have an incredible ability to drill down
into internal Solaris kernel and process level stats.  
  
Remember wait io in Solaris 10...always 0, now hardcoded.  

I could quite easily massacre the presentation as I am not writing a book
about it...  
  
Having said that there are two new Solaris performance books that I can't
provide links to because I am not online.  

I strongly recommend that anyone who can read, go and look into Dtrace it
rocks.
