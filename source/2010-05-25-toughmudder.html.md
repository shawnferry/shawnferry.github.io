For a first event I think it went well aside from some obvious logistical
problems. I'm looking forward to the one that is planned for DC in 2011. My
Garmin reports 5 miles and just over 2 hours total time 1:17 moving time.  
Saturday check-in  

  * fast easy

Sunday parking Shuttle  

  * horrible long wait (&gt; 2.5h) looked like three busses with a 30min RTT4

Sunday Check-in (waiting for the rest of the team to get checked in)  

  * fast easy

BraveHart  

  * not bad took it with a bit of caution after being warned of holes on Sat.

Death March  

  * long slog cost time and effort. I won't be thinking local climbs are so bad for a while

Sweaty Yeti  

  * yes, a bit chilly. Generally lame as an obstacle

Devils Beard  

  * With a group not bad at all, raised mesh passed from hand to hand

Hold Your Wood  

  * I went up hill with a chunk of wood

Cliff Hanger  

  * ridiculous :) I'm not sure I would want to ski down it

Boa Constrictor  

  * had been expecting this to be worse, it was a little slow needed a better way to move through the tube

Swamp Stomp  

  * felt like a little kid playing in the mud

Trail run  

  * nice trails, rocky, rooty wet and fast

Kiss of mud  

  * way slower than I expected

Ball Shrinker*  

  * a lot worse for the wear when we got there, ropes were dangling

Water Tunnel*  

  * not special

Plank*  

  * first big line. fun, swimming in shoes was slow. Hydration pack provided unexpected flotation

Walls*  

  * a bit hard being sort of tired, slick with the wet

Gorilla  

  * not bad

Slide  

  * so disappointing. Obstacle was down when we go there

Small wall  

  * great place to get muddy again after rising in the lake

Fire  

  * yes, it was fire

On course Logistics  

  * Water stops did not have enough water to cover the runners. Possibly the wave sizes were off because of the timing?
  * Lack of rigidity in wave starts was good (due to bus delays we were 1 wave behind)
  * Medical staff were prevalent and attentive
  * Other runners were encouraging
  * Course markings were clear enough
  * really glad to have taken water with me

* Waited in line for these obstacles
