So Sun has negotiated access for all Employees to the Safari eBook Library.  
  
I have used and been happy with the Safari Books before...unfortunately I find
myself slightly disapointed by the following  
  
Unable to generate a temporary class (result=1). error CS2001: Source file
'C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\pvpviplu.0.cs' could not be found error CS2008: No inputs
specified  

Not that it didn't resolve itself in a moment (presumably after the file was
copied into place) but the use of windows in the backend.  
  
Shame on you Safari Books Online, of couse if I worked for Microsoft I would
probably be happy.  
  
Maybe we are working out a trade, we get access to your books and we will help
you move to our wonderful Solaris operating system.  
In any case, Sun Managed Operations would be happy to help you implement the
migration AND monitor the entire infrastructure BOTH running on windows and
running on Solaris.  
  
Go and Register Yourself for access:
[Sunlibrary](http://sunlibrary.safaribooksonline.com/)  
I must say, that was one of the easiest self provisioning processes I have
experienced in a very long time.
