[BBC  
NEWS | Europe | France to ban smoking in
public](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6032125.stm):

My wife will be ecstatic, she is almost rabid in her dislike for  
smoking. But then it may be the surgery to remove a lung lobe that her  
mother had just after our wedding.  
  
Possibly we will go an visit Paris (Not that the smoking was preventing  
it, just that it is a bit more attractive now)  
One of the observations I made at Sun's CEC, was that every night when  
I got home(my mother hated that, and my wife isn't fond of it*) I had  
that ugg, I am going to have to wash the smoke out of my hair unless I  
want to sleep with it moment.  
  
Then I realized! no, I won't have to do that at all...no smoking in  
public places! WOOT  
  
* The first time I said to my parents that I was going home (back to  
school), when I was at home (where I/my parents live), my mother cried.  
I tend to call the place I am sleeping home.
