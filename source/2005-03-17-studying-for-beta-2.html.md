Had a nice evening of relaxation.

A co-worker's last day is ~~  
tomorrow~~today. He is not going to be in for the full day and will  
not be available ~~tomorrow ~~tonight for a going away type  
event. So a group of people were going to go to the local Irish  
place...Except for the big line and the cover charge. Who knew, St.  
Patrick's Day and all.

So the celebration moved down the street and then  
back to our new house. Now I have spent a bit more time relaxing and  
hanging out than I would have liked, and I am sure the low key partying  
will not be helping my test score.

So ~~tonight~~ now a quick  
review of RBAC, zones, PXE booting, disk suite and name services. In  
roughly that order. I think RBAC appeared in Solaris 8, I remember playing  
with it. I also remember being excited by the possibilities but  
disappointed with the execution.

As I recall the instructions were  
basically "Only change this with the SMC GUI". Now I see from the  
objectives, that the RBAC using CLI utilities is part of what should be  
covered. I have done Zones and PXE booting at home, so I think I am doing  
OK there. I am reasonably comfortable with disksuite and name services.  

Unfortunately all of the afternoon and evening got eaten up by real work  
and later revelry, so the feeble attempt at studying before bed failed  
miserably.
