I just got a "call" or really an IM then a call to figure out my skype ID  
  
A coworker is going to London and trying to figure out how to do some  
communication.  

The builtin mic on his laptop is broken, I had him plugin headphones and  
talk to them.  

He says his wife was looking at him quzically. It worked though.
