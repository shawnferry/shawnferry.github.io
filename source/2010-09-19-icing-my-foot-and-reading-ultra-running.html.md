I spent the last few hours reading ultra running blogs starting with the race
report for the Burning Man 50k with ice packs on my right foot.  
  
I think it started last Saturday when I ran 23 miles. I was tired at the end
but found myself running on and off with a big grin. Finished up, went grocery
shopping with C- and home to clean up for [Mike and Mindy's
Reception](http://photos.shawnferry.com/Weddings/Mike-and-
Mindy/13747795_fGc93#1005594000_9ztxs). I wore my new Vivo Barefoot shoes they
were comfortable but felt a little tight over the arch of my right foot.  
  
Sunday I ran an easy 6mi felt a little tired from the run and late night, my
foot hurt a little but not horribly. Monday I played hockey for only the
second time in the season and my feet started to cramp a little at the end if
the first period (I wear my skates a full size smaller than my shoes). Did an
easy 7mi on Tuesday did goal pace mile repeats on Thursday.  
Saturday I was supposed to run 18 with 8 or so at race pace instead I was
exhausted and have taken the weekend off.  
  
I thinking I will walk over to pick up some prescriptions and back just so I
do something today. Hockey game at 9:15 I'm undecided. Should I rest what is
probably tendonitits or should I play I want to run both races but if I go
into Baltimore with a nagging injury doing well at MCM is probably off the
table.
