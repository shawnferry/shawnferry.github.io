Radia hates computers :) The goals of this session and some other stuff:

  * Empower
  * Entertain
  * Don't believe what you don't understand
  * We need PKI passwords are ridiculous  

  * I don't know what they are saying, but they always say stuff like that
  * She finds herself entertained by slide junk even though it adds no value

Some things are so obvious that we shouldn't need to talk about them, however
everyone gets it wrong. IPv4 spec says use a version number of 4 but ignore
the field. What if you send IPv6? No idea, bogus.

I am really enjoying this presentation. "There is no reliable 'I am dead'
message protocol"

OSI layers above 5 are boring :)

So what about loops? spanning tree, came with a poem, this is why Radia thinks
it made her so popular (Algorhyme) which was also the abstract of her paper.

Bridges fail dangerous, start forwarding if you don't see other bridge
messages. Boston Hospital network meltdown when bridges couldn't keep up with
wire speed.

TRILL - TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (in IEFT)

Brain infestation: Data making it be there when you want it but making it gone
when you want it gone (assured delete)

Woot! Slide decks are not the way to disseminate information, small papers and
such.

Interesting observation: If everything was encrypted end to end you can't
detect spam before it gets to you.

Now a short rant on VLANs

This was great!
