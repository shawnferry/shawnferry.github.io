We are now officially the "Rink Rats" we couldn't get the "Farging Ice Holes",
I was also partial to pylons.  
  
We won 2-1, nearly shocking. Next game is a nice early 11:00pm.  
  
My foot didn't bother me and thankfully the Refs were a little late so I had
time to stretch out on the ice. A little short on stamina but I haven't been
on the ice for at least a month and I really slacked off on the running and
other generally health things in Vegas and China.
