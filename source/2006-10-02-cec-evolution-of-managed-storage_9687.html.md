There was a high degree of overlap information as Managed Storage is part of
Managed Operations.  
  
Effectively all Managed Operations presentations contain a this is Managed
Operations Section.  

Of note the presentation successfully crashed StarOffice 4-5 times  

What I learned in broad strokes:  

We support extensive backup and Restore SLAs.  
  
A wider range of storage devices than I knew about.  

Quite informational all in all.
