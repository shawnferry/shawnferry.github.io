Recently some complaints have surfaced about keyboard access to form elements
in Firefox 2 in OS X. I don't see the problem.

I have Full keyboard access for "All Controls" set in System Preferences ->
Keyboard & Mouse -> Keyboard Shortcuts  

I have "Enable Access for assistive devices" set in System Preferences ->
Universal Access (although I don't think this is related, IIRC it is for some
other programs that I use)

Since a video is the easiest way I can think of to show this, here you go:

If anyone happens to know what configuration changes you might need to make to
get this working please feel free to let me know. I don't recall making
changes other than the above.
