Went for a run Saturday morning in part because I need to start getting more
exercise again and in part as a dry run for the Leesburg, VA 5th annual Freeze
Your Gizzard race.  
  
6mi in 1:09:00, over did it a little but I was running to the office and back
to pick up my laptop power supply that I had left on Friday. I should have
slowed down on the return leg instead of speeding up. A little sore and
although I stretched the crap out of my soleus my Right 5th Metatarsal is
aching.  
  
Some heat to keep it loose and some ibuprofen and I am good for my nice early
10PM hockey game tonight. First game of the Winter season; glad I had that
early meeting this morning.
