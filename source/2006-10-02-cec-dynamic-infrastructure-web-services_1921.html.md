Network Scale Visualized Modular Computing  

DI is a way to do and manage netowkr-scale architecture for modular,
horizontal services with virtualization.  

Rapid and frequent code updates are wanted/needed/required.  
  
Rolling changes, easy fail-back.  

Moving to dynamic container based deployment allows very safe deployment and
rollback.  
  
Create a container, deploy to container, point to container, fail back/destroy
old container.  

It looks cool, dynamic allocation and consolidation.  

The process in general looks like the individual SPS steps could be glued
together into one larger fire and forget action.  

Thoughts:  
  
It is hard to do a demo that requires access to a hard to reach network
(SWAN).  
  
Might have benefited from some screen shots for the process that could have
failed.
