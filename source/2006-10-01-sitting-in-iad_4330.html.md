An hour till the plane is supposed to depart.  
  
....45 min theoretically there are 20 Sun employees on this flight  
  
So far 2 (me, Stacia), (ok just saw a sun polo shirt on domeone I don't know)  
  
Time to board...more inane commentairy as we go.  
  
I am sure this will be nearly unreadable since convert line breaks doen not
appear to be applied automatically.
