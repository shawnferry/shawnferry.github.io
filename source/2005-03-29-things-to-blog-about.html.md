I keep coming up with things I want to blog about when I don't have  
time... Then when I have time I don't have the energy or I look back and  
say well that was hours/days/weeks ago and is no longer relevant. Maybe I  
will do something about that. Possible future topic include: * Our New  
house * Solaris 10 in my basement * Security Systems * Vonage/VOIP *  
Internal Call routing, 911 and Vonage * Photography * Our Old House (For  
Sale, almost) * Hosting dinner for 14, weeks after moving * Why an airport  
express is cool, particularly with in ceiling speakers * Silt fences and  
the river in my back yard * rebuilding my firewall to Solaris 10 I like  
IPF and Solaris, I think I will like them together * Setting up my little  
sony to be a jumpstart server * del.icio.us, can I get a feed from my  
del.icio.us account in this blog?
