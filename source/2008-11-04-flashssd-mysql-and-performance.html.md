It seems that MySQL and SSD performance is popular. I just saw [Kazuho at
Work: Benchmarking SSD for
MySQL](http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/kazuhoatwork/2008/10/benchmarking_ssd_for_mysql.php)
and last night I listened to [Blog Talk Radio: Innovation Insider - Flash
Memory
Technology](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/stations/sunradio/InnovationInsider/2008/06/26
/Flash-Memory-Technology) with Michael Cornwell. The latter discusses more
than flash performance with references to MySQL benchmarking. It also covers
price/performance, reliabilty and the economics of power consumption and heat
dissipation for SSD vs spinning storage.
