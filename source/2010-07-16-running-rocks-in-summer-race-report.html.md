On a working farm, the trail is decorated with bones

Rockland Farm in Leesburg is a private working farm that happens to have
periodic riding and running events, primarily mountain bike racing with [Plum
Grove Cyclery](http://plumgrovecyclery.com/) and now trail running with
[Potomac River Running](http://www.potomacriverrunning.com). Sunday's race
offered two options ~8mi and ~4mi courses. Having already put in my weekend
workout I went with a camera planning to run a little and take pictures. I am
looking forward to getting out there and racing the next one.  

After the rain and the MTB race the day before I was wondering how the trail
would be holding up. The parts of the course I saw were fast, dry, smooth and
clear with some rocks, logs and roots to keep you from getting distracted.
Humidity was fairly low and it was very pleasant running in the shade. On a
Mountain Bike I would call the course fairly flat but as a runner I would call
some parts gently rolling.

As with any inaugural event there were a few issues that need to be worked
out. The course had a single water stop which was supposed to be around the
middle of the overlapping course. For the long course the water was closer to
6 miles, combined with mile markers only at the first and last mile a number
of long course runners were under the impression that they had become lost on
the course and those running without watches were glad to hear that they were
nearly done.

The field for each race was fairly small with the short course at 27 and the
long course boasting only 30 runners. On the course each of the eventual
winners was in the lead over the next runner by over a minute.

Based on the times in the pictures the long course heated up after the water
stop with second to sixth place all within a minute. Second place finisher
Dirk Plante passed 4th place Charlie Mercer and 5th place Dennis Billings
while making up about a minute on winner David Wagner and 37 seconds on 3rd
place Jess Laurent extending the gap to 5 seconds at the finish.

The short course got started at almost exactly 8:02 with eventual short course
winner Van Arnold taking off to an early lead.
