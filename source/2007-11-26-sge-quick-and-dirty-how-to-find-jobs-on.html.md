I occasionally have a need to find queues in Sun Grid Engine that are in one
of the possibly problematic states which have an occupied slot. It is just
infrequent enough that I don't remember exactly how I did it the last time.

An alternate is "qstat -f | awk '$6~/[cdsuE]/ && $3~/^[1-9]/'" which also
avoids printing the header line. In the example above 'state' in $6 matches
's' and 'used' does not begin with '0'.  
  
The possibly more elegant 'qstat -f -qs cdsuE' still requires a second
comparison in awk of '$0!~/--/' to filter out the queue separator lines.
(qstat -f -qs acduE | awk '$0!~/--/ && $3!~/^[0]/')  
  
Finally because I can never remember what exactly all the queue states are and
the qstat man page doesn't have the nice table:

>  
>  aoACD #8211 Number of queue instances that are in at least one of the
following states:  
>  a #8211 Load threshold alarm  
>  o #8211 Orphaned  
>  A #8211 Suspend threshold alarm  
>  C #8211 Suspended by calendar  
>  D #8211 Disabled by calendar

>  u #8211 Unknown  
>  E #8211 Error

Edit: Added Job Status, literally couldn't find that in any of the online docs
(notwithstanding ~40% through the
[qstat(1)](http://gridengine.sunsource.net/nonav/source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman//htmlman1/qstat.html
"qstat\(1\) man page at sunsource" ) man page, targeted google searches do a
poor job finding the link)
