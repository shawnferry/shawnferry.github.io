I ordered/donated an [OLPC](http://laptop.org/en/index.shtml) XO-1 as part of
the [Give One Get One program](http://laptopgiving.org/en/index.php)  
these are the pictures that ThinGuy scolded me for not posting a month ago.

These pictures are from un-boxing the OLPC and booting it for the first time.
I have enjoyed using it. The keyboard is a little small for adult hands (this
is not a surprise or a criticism). The trans-reflective screen is impressively
clear, the backlit screen is a little hard to read for small text (at least
for me).  
  
The packaging is sparse but solid, my favorite part of the whole delivery
presentation is the warnings page, particularly "Not for use by Infants."  
  
All in all I am glad I donated.
