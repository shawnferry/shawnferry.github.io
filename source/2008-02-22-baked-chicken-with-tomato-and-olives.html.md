I slacked off and used canned tomato, it is easier. The original recipe calls
for capers but we are out.

The chicken is baked from frozen from the costco bag-o-chicken.

  * 4 chicken breast halves
  * 1 small yellow onion, diced
  * 1.5 tbps chopped garlic
  * ~20 small Spanish pimento olives (didn't weigh them), diced
  * Salt and Pepper to taste
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 2 cans diced tomato, drained

Chicken (from frozen):

  1. Heat oven to 350 deg
  2. Place chicken in baking dish, brush lightly with olive oil (or spray with cooking spray)
  3. Bake ~25 min
  4. Top with tomato olive mixture, bake additional 10min

Tomato, Olive topping (Start while heating oven):

  1. Heat the oil, lightly brown the garlic. Take a moment to appreciate the smell of cooking garlic
  2. Add the onion cook until slightly translucent
  3. Turn up the heat to medium and add olives, heat until hot, stir a bit
  4. Add tomato, simmer for ~10 min
  5. With ~10min left on the chicken, top with tomato mixture

Enjoy with a salad and possibly a carb, Basic recipe from "How to Cook
Anything"

This is a picture of me taking a picture of dinner (or really the food I pre-
cooked for dinner some time next week).

Using a [Joby Gorillapod SLR-
ZOOM](http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/slrzoom/ "Joby Site" ), Nikon
D1x, Nikon 17-35/2.8 AF-S and MC30 cable release. The Joby has a little bit of
vibration when I let go of the D1x so I wait for a moment and fire with the
cable release
