Well, this one did not go as well. I think that name services will end up  
being my downfall. I have only ever really worked with NIS once. It was  
very specific and required a lot of knowledge about how NIS works,  
unfortunately it was in no way a traditional use. I am also sure that I  
blew a few RBAC questions. I am tempted to see if there are any openings  
left and try to take the exam again (after a bit more studying). So anyone  
who is reading this and has yet to take the Exam...you should think about  
a review of name services, RBAC, PXE booting or really everything in the  
testing objectives.
