Checking to see if Ecto 3.0b20 can download this entry before I say anything
about it in mail. I thought it was working now, but it might only be updates
to entries that it already knows about.

Edit: It worked.

Edit: It also picked up the edit (and I expect, will pick this one up as well)
but if I keep updating to say this this post will get really old really fast
