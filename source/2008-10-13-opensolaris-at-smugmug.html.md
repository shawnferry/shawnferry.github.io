Don MacAskill has written about his experiences with Solaris and OpenSolaris
at SmugMug. Most recently about his experiences using [MySQL and OpenSolaris
as a slave in one of SmugMug's production database
clusters](http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2008/10/10/success-with-opensolaris-
zfs-mysql-in-production/). Today Don published an up[date on MySQL, InnoDB and
ZFS compression](http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2008/10/13/zfs-mysqlinnodb-
compression-update/).

You may now be saying to yourself, yes but other people have posted about this
already, and you would be correct. Aside from being interesting articles the
second article uses a picture I took during the setup of network.com in Las
Vegas :)
