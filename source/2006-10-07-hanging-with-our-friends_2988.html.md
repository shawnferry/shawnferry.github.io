C- and I are at our friends [Jim](http://blogs.sun.com/systemsmonkey) and
Emily's for Jim's Birthday. Talking about our normal array of random topics.  
  
Jim has yet to post, but his wife has indicated that he should not post about
her at all.  
  
Jim was at CEC with the managed operations crew...he says he will be posting
shortly.
