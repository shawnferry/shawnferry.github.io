10 Days, 10 Hours, 10 Minutes and 10 Seconds

I have been training for that last 20 weeks to run [the Baltimore
marathon](http://www.thebaltimoremarathon.com/site3.aspx "The Baltimore
Marathon" ). My first ever marathon and the first time I have done any real
training for a running race. I have been training with the [Ashburn Area
Running Club](http://www.runashburn.org/frames.asp) and [Potomac River
Running](http://www.potomacriverrunning.com/) as part of the AARC distance
training program.

My goals for this run in order of preference:

  1. Finish in 4:45
  2. Finish in less than 5:00
  3. Finish on my feet

I got new shoes four weeks ago ([Asics Nimbus
10](http://www.asicsamerica.com/nimbus10/)) they are broken in (and extremely
similar to my old Asics Cumulus). As of this moment my first concern is
getting sick. [Cdash](/cdash/) is currently coughing up yellow phlegm and
feeling miserable. Otherwise I have yet to run the full distance but I did run
most all of the hills on the course on a 20 mile training run two weeks ago.

I am working on live tracking for the event, more details as I work them out.
