I have had these pictures sitting on my laptop for about 1/2 a year. I pulled
a couple out for a screen cast that I still haven't published because the
audio blows. I have been doing a better job again on publishing pictures
shortly after I take them. [Network.com](http://www.network.com/) is the Sun
Grid Compute Utility, I have a few pictures from the on site work.
