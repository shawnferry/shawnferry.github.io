I am currently working on our presentation for the Sun Continuing Engineering
Conference 2006.

We are presenting "Managing Systems at Grid Scale"

In December 2005 Sun Managed Operations (aka SevenSpace) took over the
infrastructure management for commercial and retail sungrid deployments.
Managing at grid scale raises many challenges to tools and operations mind-
sets when compared to traditional enterprise systems management.

I am going to go home and try to work on my slides.

Things to do at CEC:  
Find Bill Walker and try to get a [Very cool fridge
magnet...](http://blogs.sun.com/mrbill/entry/very_cool_fridge_magnet)

I will have to bring my oh so tiny Solaris Laptop with me.
