I have a friend who is involved with the structural work of building of
satellites and such.  

I have noticed that I don't have any readers (or even vaguely interested
parties in Antarctica). After a recent event we were discussing yakshaving and
I pulled up my blog. The
[Clustrmap](http://clustrmaps.com/counter/maps.php?url=http://blogs.sun.com/yakshaving)
of my blog shows the above lack of interest.  

My friend Steve is hoping that he will be able to go to [McMurdo
Station](http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/support/mcmurdo.jsp) for
[CREAM](http://cosmicray.umd.edu/cream/cream.html)
[III(2007)](http://cosmicray.umd.edu/cream/CREAMflight2007/). He allowed that,
as he was hoping to be down that way, that he would be happy to visit my blog
to try and create a little dot on the map for me.  

Which reminds me of a recent commercial...["Who's Agitating My
Dots?"](http://www.untitledfilms.ca/movies/Dots_30_b.mov)  

On an yakshaving related note the [New Horizons Probe to
Pluto](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/spacecraft/overview.html) was also built by
Steve (and or his company, that I can't remember the name of or find).
