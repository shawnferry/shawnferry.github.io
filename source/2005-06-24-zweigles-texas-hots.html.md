We recently got a Wegmans (grocery store, supermarket, really kick butt  
food other junk place)  
  
One of C-'s coworkers/friends is from Upstate NY (The home of Wegmans),  
and asked us to check and see if they had any "Zweigles Texas Hots"  
  
"Zweigles Texas Hots" are apparently also a product of Upstate NY.  
Prompting the question from a coworker (and former resident of Texas) of  
mine: "Why is everything that has Texas in the name not from Texas?"  
  
So "Zweigles Texas Hots" are hotdogs/frankfurters. Red and White  
variety. No skin and Natural Pop-Open casing.  

Also: Tastes Good
