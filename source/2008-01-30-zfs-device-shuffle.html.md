I shot this video/screencast demo thing nine or ten months ago. The audio from
the datacenter was terrible. I have been sitting on it and some voice overs
that I wasn't pleased with for about 4 months. Today I decided that it was
time finally get it published, did another voice over and while it isn't
perfect its good enough.

This video was inspired by [CSI:
Munich](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8100808442979626078) I watched
it and thought, wait I have an x4500!

Here instead we will try an object embedded quicktime found at [Bye Bye
Embed](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/byebyeembed), the video above is
being served from the all new and improved http://mediacast.sun.com

Edit: I have uploaded an amplified version, it appears that unless you are
using good isolation earbuds or have relatively good quality speakers you
can't really hear the audio portion. The trial copy of "[Sound
Studio](http://www.freeverse.com/apps/app/?id=5012)" I downloaded did a
wonderful job of letting me amplify the audio. The audio and video are the
same, only the link has changed (It does not appear possible to replace the
original content )  
  
While I was at it we just released a new version of mediacast.sun.com (I could
never get my login to the old one working). For some reason smugmug is taking
23MB of video and reprocessing it to 94MB. I can download that in about 3
minutes but the size is ridiculous. (No wonder my wife said it took forever to
play)

(This is the smugmug video, I still like the interface it just isn't quite
doing it for me otherwise)

Â Edit: A bit of clarity I should go to bed at 02:30 instead of messing with my
blog
