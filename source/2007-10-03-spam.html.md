I have been getting a relatively large number of spam bounces.

It has been quite some time since someone was sending mail forged from my
address. Actually from close to my address. It seems that google doesn't count
some variations ad different addresses.

e.g. bsmith and bs.mith at google are treated the same. I am getting bounces
to the latter delivered to my mailbox which is in the format of the former.
