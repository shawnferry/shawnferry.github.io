In about 1:30 I will sit down to take the [Solaris 10 Beta
Exam](http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/beta.html) Part 1 I
also participated in the [Sage Certification](www.sage.org)  
Beta Process as well. (Since I passed I am cSAGE certified) This sounds a lot  
like the Sage beta process. The testing time is 4:15, I expect to be hit  
with all of the possible candidate questions for the production exam. With  
none of the immediate feedback. For all of my efforts playing with Solaris  
10 at home, I wonder how well it will go. I haven't had nearly the time to  
play with everything that I have wanted to play with. So now having had a  
half hour or so to review the options for smf related commands one last  
time I am off.  
  
Edit: 10/12/2006, noticed some obnoxious content errors that I don't think
used to exist, and applied the line breaks plugin
