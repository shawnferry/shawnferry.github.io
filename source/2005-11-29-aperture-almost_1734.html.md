Am I on the bandwagon or am I out in front about to get run over?  

I got a shipping notification from apple...only after I had already seen  
the ups, "you need to sign for this" note on the door.  

If they had sent it three hours earlier, I would have come home early to  
receive it.  

Capture ONE LE, did almost everything I think I want but not all at the  
same time  

~$120  
  
Capture ONE PRO, better but I had some trouble trying to get it to do  
what I wanted even though it should be supported. (multiple sessions,  
multiple settings at once on an image)  

~$590  
  
Aperture, looks like it does basically everything I want and more,  
hopefully it isn't too slow on my not quite supported powerbook  

$499 ( $249 go student discount)  
  
The price is right, Aperture wins even thought I am drinking the apple  
kool-aide buying a product that I have only ever seen in demo videos  
probably running on the biggest baddest fastest quad G5s with 16GB of  
RAM and an X-serve RAID array behind it.
