with black bean suace at Chinatown Express in DC.  
  
prior to that steamed buns (pork)  
  
prior to that the Washington Capitals lost to the Tampabay Lightning 6 to 3  
  
I was feeling adventureous.  
Fortunately the squid was good...although I am not sure how I was supposed to
eat the big one with chop sticks.  
Especially as it was hard to sever the tentacles with only my teeth.  [![Squid
