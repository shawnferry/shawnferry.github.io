I have been listening to/watching the Sun internal Blade Summit. (Really a
couple of days ago, but I never got around to posting this)  

Interesting notes on hardware in general. The things that struck me the most
about the general hardware discussion was the power cost of FB-DIMMS. The
expectation is that with the high power consumption of FB-DIMMS that the
memory will use more, even significantly more power than the CPUs. We have
more IO and higher CPU density. That even with the memory power consumption
and our higher slot density we still come in at lower power consumption rates.
Everything is fully hot swap and hot plug.  

Of course there are an incredible number of other cool things that are
available now and that will be available soon. Unfortunately as I am attending
this because I am interested and I have customers that may be deploying full
chassis in relatively large numbers. I can't quite justify not doing
everything else I needed to do today.  

Had I been paying more attention to the whole thing I would have a better feel
about which of the really cool things I can freely talk about.

Mean Time Service Interruption (MTSI) is reduced, fewer components == fewer
failures. Fewer higher reliability fans and power supplies etc.  

The concerns aren't really any different. Cooling capacity, Floor Space,
Power.  High density in blades helps address floor space. Cooling and Power
are the new black.  
Peter Snelling, just gave a very interesting and compelling talk about the
limitations caused by power draw and as a result cooling capacity.

I had to drop off again, but not before one of the parts I had been waiting
for. The management aspects and how the Chassis and Blade management would
interact. Not much of a surprise, now I just want to get my hands on a few and
play.
