I use dynamic dns for access to my systems at home. Unfortunately it  
appears that my DHCP lease has expired. I set up a cron job to refresh my  
source address daily, when I get home tonight I will have to switch to  
hourly. EDIT: Because of a runaway double quote everything below this line  
was hidden before. [FreeDNS](freedns.afraid.org) works quite  
well and the price is right. All of these problems will go away when I am  
able to get static addresses from my broadband provider. Even then I don't  
know that I will stop using FreeDNS, I will just manually setup the  
entries. Well, off to school... Just remember, don't slack off on your  
school work to play with computers the first time around. Although if I  
hadn't done that 10 years ago maybe I wouldn't be where I am today.
