Sitting in the "Web2.0" CEC starting general session.  
  
Only I can't get on the provided wireless.  
  
I can't see it, I can see some other random networks including  
"Free Public WiFi" to which I can connect but not reach anything.  
  
So I have been using SMS and email, but not AIM to interact with the
presenters.  
It is cool, but it would be more so if I could get/stay online.  
  
I am trying to sneak in posts as I get online for a moment.
