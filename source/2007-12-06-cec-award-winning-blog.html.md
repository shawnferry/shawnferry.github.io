I won an award for blogging. It turns out that I had the "Best Wow Blog" at
CEC.  

I am still not sure what exactly a wow blog is. I made a note to see if there
was contest information  
on SWAN but I haven't checked yet.  
  
Hopefully this isn't a sympathy prize :)  
  
Once I find out a bit more I'll let you know. I did win a prize, more about
that later.
