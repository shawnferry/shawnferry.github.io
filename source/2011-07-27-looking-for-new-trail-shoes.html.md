I can now put my fingers through the sides of both of my NorthFace
Singletracks, the duct tape in the left heel is working out well and I didn't
get a blister where the heel cup had started pressing and the liner is wearing
out. The soles and midsole seem fine but the rest of the shoes have seen
better days after 350 miles.

On Monday Saucony came out to =PR= in Leesburg and had their [Men's ProGrid
Peregrine](http://www.saucony.com/store/SiteController/saucony/productdetails;jsessionid=EEED20FF3A8DD512371608E9A9B25AF6

available. I really liked how light they were and the grip felt good on the
moderate terrain near Leesburg. The cushioning seemed somewhat minimal but
sufficient (two days post a foot pounding 50k). The minimal drop seemed fine.
If they had a wider toe box I would have bought a pair

On Tuesday Adidas came out to =PR= Ashburn and brought out a something zero, I
don't think it is released yet. It it was super light and felt cool and
breezy. The cushioning was not quiet enough for me and as is the trend the toe
box was narrow even having gone up a size to get it wide enough for my foot in
general.
