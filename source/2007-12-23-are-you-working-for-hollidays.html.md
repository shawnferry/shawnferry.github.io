Except for the possible negative of driving more traffic over to [Mrs.
Skrocki](http://blogs.sun.com/lskrocki) further cementing her in the list of
hot bloggers at Sun. Her [Putting 1st things 1st
post](http://blogs.sun.com/lskrocki/entry/putting_1st_things_1st) is apropos
of the season and the prevalent view at Sun.  
  
With the exception of lugging my laptop along incase something breaks (I am on
call) I am avoiding thoughts of work as much as possible.  
  
All my previous thoughts about poking about in CAC or changing/updating my
blog theme are on hold, now back to watching last nights hockey game and
working on China pictures, possibly going to see [Sweeney
Todd](http://www.sweeneytoddmovie.com/) before dinner with @cdash's mother
later tonight.
