On a totally shocking note, [Opera](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Opera) on the
[XO-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1) works great with
[smugmug.com](http://lalartu.smugmug.com/)! I was guessing that it would choke
on high volume picture sites. I was able to take these pictures, browse to my
smugmug page and upload them. Java isn't working as a plugin so I had to use
the old browser POST method.

Having proven I was able to blog from the [OLPC](http://laptop.org/) XO-1 I
have moved back to using [ecto](http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/) for
normal blogging. Trying to add images and links by hand is just not what I
want to be doing at the moment.  
  
Give 1 Get 1 is still going, it isn't too late to donate one for yourself.
