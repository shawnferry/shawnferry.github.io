The ability to utilize network services while I am on a call.  
That and enough battery power to be online all day.  
Also a threaded mail reader  
Possibly a web browser that will not actively connect to the network when it
is not downloading.  
  
While it is not generally recommended to distract yourself on calls, I don't
always follow that advice.  
  
I must say, being able to read my mail and see messages as they come in Is
quite useful.  
Particularly when people are telling you that they just sent mail that
explains everything.  
  
That is afterall the ONLY thing I would be doing.  
Not reading blogs or anything like that. No Sir!
