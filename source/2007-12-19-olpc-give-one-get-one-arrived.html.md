I am sitting here in my office writing this entry on my OLPC (One Laptop Per
Child) XO-1. It arrived last night.  
  
my first impressions:  
The packaging is sparse but sturdy, Two bits of paper with a note and the
saftey warnings (no babies is first on the list). I am guessing that this
isn't humor but I am entertained.  
  
The keyboard has a nice feel for a membrane type keyboard, the keys have a
slight depression which makes them fairly easy to feel. It is a little small
for my hands (a good thing given the target market).I tried an external
keyboard and mouse (they worked as I was expecting) but I have revirted to the
built in.  
  
I have had some issues with the stock browser in terms of speed and
compatabiliy. It also seems that downoloads from the browser disapear (I am
probably missing something simple). Installing Opera does the trick for me. It
brings back tabs! Image rendering is more consistent and reliable and I can
choose a download location. Vital sites such as this blog, the full twitter
web interface and google reader all work and appear correct. Sites of
importance such as the managed operations portal also work.  
  
Wireless support is quite good, at least as sensitive as my full size devices,
with the exception of WPA support (comming soon), in the end I backed down the
security stance of of my APs and turned on MAC filtering.  
  
Remaining issues: paste, Copy seems to work, I can drag from the frame and
paste into applications. Why can't I paste text into the terminal?  
  
I am sure that many of you are now asking the same question...but will it run
solaris? I think the answer is probably not. Atleast not with a gui.  
  
Still others are likely wondering, will it run the super beta punchin for
linux. To that I am thinking no, but man that would be sweet!
