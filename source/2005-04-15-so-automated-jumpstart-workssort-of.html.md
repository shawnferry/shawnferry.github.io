So I have downloaded the latest Nevada build and added it to my jumpstart  
server. However after installing I see SunOS 5.10 s10_72 Now I am not sure  
exactly what I should be seeing but I know it should be SunOS 5.10.1 What  
is really confusing me is that I have removed all of the other instances  
b72, GA... But it still appears that I am installing b72. This makes no  
sense to me. More digging.
