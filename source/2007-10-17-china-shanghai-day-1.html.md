By the time we got to the hotel we had been up for ~25 hours. The flight was
fine, a little bit worried at first when I went to check the status and saw
canceled at 04:00 (it had been pushed back 7 minutes). Once we landed our
guide was right past customs which was fortunate given the high volume of
passengers and people waiting for them.

After about an hour in a van going to the hotel we checked in (now in a suite,
not what we were expecting, we seem to have gotten a bump to the executive
levels). @cdash took a bath to clear her sinuses and the rest of us went for a
walk in the park across the street so we wouldn't fall asleep before we meant
to. We took some pictures in the park, got turned around and made it back to
the hotel for dinner.
