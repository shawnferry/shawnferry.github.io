We just got a message telling us that we have a walkthrough/inspection of  
our new house on the 18th and a tentative settlement date of the 25th.  
  
Exciting and scary at the same time. It has been a long wait and I am  
ready to move.  

It looks like the next couple of weeks will be all about the last of the  
packing and cleanup of the current house.  

...off to clean and pack
