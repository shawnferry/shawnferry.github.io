Cycled to work on tuesday...my computer is out since the last time I rode.  
My sister happened to be leaving for work at the same time, our routes are  
identical for the first 3 miles or so. After three miles I turned off for  
the ~.5 miles to my office while she continued the 12-13 miles to her  
office.  
  
It is almost not worth riding so short a distance. I think I need to  
take a few spins around the block just to ride long enough for a good  
warmup.  

Wednesday, fairly normal work with the exception of some package install  
problems. Bouncing package builds across the big pond is not the most  
efficient testing method we have ever used. School was...well school,  
nothing special at the moment.  

Thursday, took my car in for service at 06:00, that is way to early. The  
regular service was as expected. However the "you really need two new  
tires (the ones I mentioned looking bald), however the other two are  
almost ready for replacement as well"; with pricetag was not what I was  
hoping for. So later today my wallet will be an unexpected 1K  
lighter..damn performance touring tires.  

I am also displeased by the wear life of the OEM tires. I have been  
reading reviews that seem to indicate that in some ways I am lucky to  
have gotten ~30K miles on them, in others it seems that I should have  
been able to get 40-50K. In the future I am avioding the "Bridgestone  
Turanza EL42".
