I find that I have developed a method of sorts for posting.  
  
  1. Think, hey I should blog about this
  2. Create a post in an editor 
    1. Nvu
    2. docs.google.com
    3. ecto (although I have line break issues that I can't seem to workout)
    4. vi
  3. Re-read it to make sure I don't sound like a raving lunatic (unless that is the goal)
  4. Spell check (Firefox 2.0RC3 inline spell check is my favorite new capability)
  5. Publish Post 
    1. u*blog for treo
      * works reasonably well
      * no HTML, I copy &lt;br/&gt; and paste it as needed to achieve readable flow
    1. Found a problem with docs.google.com 
      * It appears to have issues with nested lists
      * unless you change back to numbers before you outdent  

    2. docs.google.com 
      * works reasonably well, has issues with time offset
      * writes fairly clean HTML, but posts it without line breaks
      * messing around with entry from multiple locations may break update(re-publish) capability
      * subsequent updates cause the offset problem again
    3. ecto 
      * great publishing and management tool
      * has problems with time offset (or hard to determine setting that works correctly)  

      * Not so hot on getting output to look as expected 
        * Losing line breaks unexpectedly
        * RTF convert linebreaks does not appear to work as expected
    4.  blogs.sun.com (roller)  

      * Not fond of any of the built in editors
      * New inline editor is coming, (I followed a link and looked at it, not bad, but now can't find the link)
      * Time on post always as expected :)
      * With Firefox 2.0RC3 inline spellcheck fixes one of my biggest gripes
  6. Read post online to try and make sure I didn't miss anything stupid
  7. Update numerous times to bother people using RSS readers which show updates
  8. Wonder if anyone cares
  9. Manically bounce on the CMD-R to see if my page hit counter is increasing
  10. Check Google Analytics Frequently (even though updates are only once a day)
  11. Occasionally wonder how time of posting affects readership 
    * Do you get more readers if you post right about break, lunch, after dinner time?
    * If you do time your posts does it help more with readers of the b.s.c homepage?
    * Do RSS readers increase your page views?
    * Should this post be held until morning so as not to be buried?
    * Maybe posted now and forward dated
    * Running out of things to put in the list  

  12. Wonder how many people have read this far and think you are crazy
