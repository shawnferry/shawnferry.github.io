While we were at CEC the topic of remote collaboration came  
up.Specifically the benefit of getting a fair amount of the
href="http://www.sun.com/service/mgdopservices/index.xml">Sun  
Managed Operations team back together in a team building type  
(Bar) environment.  
  
From there discussion of virtual communication and similar topics was  
broached.  We talked about using [AIM](www.aim.com),  
[IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat),  
[MUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)/
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH">MUSH/
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">MOO and a  
couple of related tangents. We then talked about using
href="http://secondlife.com/">SecondLife as the  
location for collaboration after Jonathan mentioned using it for a  
press conference.  
  
The first thing I thought about in this discussion was using a MUSH at  
theurgy.digex.net (now defunct) for communication, and some play. I  
remember reading
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/remy/documents/cncmast.html"  
target="_blank">'Collaborative Networked Communication' by  
Remy Evard (
href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa93/full_papers/evard.txthttp://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa93/full_papers/evard.txt">Original  
ASCII although I must admit that I had to search for it and I  
thought it was written be someone else).  
  
The paper gives example usages which I will not repeat here, however  
the thought was that having effectively a room in which to talk could  
be beneficial in our current environment.  Many managed  
operations employees are flex or are not in the main office in  
Ashburn.  A couple of times people have attempted to establish  
standing AIM chat groups/rooms and IRC channels. None of them has  
garnered even small scale adoption.  
  
So the end result here, is that I have created a SecondLife account and  
we will try playing around with SecondLife. The next steps to bring  
back some of the old theurgy magic would be to create a some objects a  
spleen (so you can vent it), some skinheads (
href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/c/campervanbeethovenlyrics/taketheskinheadsbowlinglyrics.html">to  
take bowling), a happy fun ball (to taunt), a tonka truck (to  
beep the horn and run into people's ankles) and I may be crossing  
servers a game of connect four.  
  
I just don't know that I need the avatar based communication model.  
 Location/Room/Channel based communication to allow for better  
focus and separation of relevant content makes sense to me, it is just  
the rest that I don't think I understand/see the need for the rest of  
it.SecondLife appears to have a relatively heavy footprint, when I am  
navigating around about 50-75% of my CPU and 250+MB memory.  
 This could be another case of buy a new computer, the one you  
are using is 4 years old.  
  
Possibly with a bit less friction and a bit more free processing power  
it interaction would be a smoother and I would see more of an enabling  
technology and less of a drain on my overloaded resources.  
  
In any case Sun is holding a Press conference about just this topic,  
I'll be there.
