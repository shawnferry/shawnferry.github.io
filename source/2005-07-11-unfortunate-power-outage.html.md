Had a power outage at home this weekend. I wasn't there so I don't know  
how long it was.  

I do however know that it was long enough to run down my APC 2200.  

The problem here is that the old flaky hardware that I have been using  
for my main server appears to have lost it's powersupply.  

sigh
