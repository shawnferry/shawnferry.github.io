...and other observations on the way to CEC.  
  
No snack...they are out, haven't had any for a couple of days. No meal,
however for $5 I got a nice sized salad.  
  
Looking up the asile I can see 11 LCD screens showing the same movie.  
  
No two of them the same or even really similar colors.  
  
one sepia  
  
the rest cast with magenta, yellowed, cyan and a green  
two black and white (the exception to the matching)  
  
one with apparently good color  
  
Now just as I get some coffee the fasten seatbelt sign comes on and we get a
warning about turbulence.  
  
The coffee is fairly good though.  
  
The attendants are cheerful enough and friendly.  
  
I am glad I have my etymotic ear plugs though as the guy sitting next to me
has his headphones up loud enough that if I concentrate I can just about make
out the dialogue from the movie.  
  
Below should be a tag, however I know it isn't but I know how to fix it later.  
  
On the ground and connected again.
