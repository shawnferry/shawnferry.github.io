Somehow it appears that two of my posts are out of order...  
I don't think I edited them and changed the posting time before trying to get
them to show up as expected again.  
  
In any case I am sure that I posted the first two parts of creating an SMF
service in order;[Part
1](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/yakshaving?entry=creating_an_smf_service_part)
was posted before [Part
2](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/yakshaving?entry=creating_an_smf_service_part1).  
  
The entry names make me sure of that as well. Additional posts that have the
same subject for the length used to create the permalink appear to have
numerals appended.
