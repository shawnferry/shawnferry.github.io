I just talked to my youngest sister, she has two job offers and doesn't  
know which way to go. I am more partial to the one that is near my house.  
The offers are substantially similar, one company has a reasonable web  
presence and some transparency as to who they are and what they do. The  
other has a poor web presence and I can't find anything useful about them.  
She interned with the former over the summer and has a good feeling about  
them, she doesn't have a bad feeling about the other so that is no help. I  
fear that I wasn't much help either.
