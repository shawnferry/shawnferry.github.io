Went for a ride on Firday after I got home from work. I determined that.  
  
  1.   
I have no idea where the lid for my camelbak bladder is  

  2.   
It really is time for a new helmet  

  3.   
I need a better place to wear the battery for my headlamp  

  4.   
It is obnoxious when your front wheel is loose  

  5.   
(4a really) Shearing off your skewer is not condusive to a good ride  

  6.   
(4b) C-'s road bike is now short a skewer  

  7.   
My bike pump may be in need of replacement as even I am having  
problems with it  

  8.   
It took me over an hour to get out the door for an ~30min ride  

  9.   
My front brake alignment was a simple fix  

  10.   
I felt great after the ride  

  11.   
~7miles at 14.4 mph  

  12.   
(11a) I rode to the office and back  

I had to edit the source of this entry to get out of that list.
