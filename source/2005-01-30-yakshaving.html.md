The displayed definition is truncated.  
  
YakShaving v. intr. [MIT AI Lab, after 2000: orig. probably from a Ren &amp;  
Stimpy episode.] Any seemingly pointless activity which is actually  
necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several  
levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you're working on.  
  
I expect that I will use this space to detail aspects of the Yaks I  
shave. Exciting times.
