As I alluded to earlier, I won "Best Wow Blog" for CEC 2007. The Judging
criteria was  

> _Best Wow Blog:_  
>  Blog that is about CEC and leverages as many different technologies as
possible to communicate its message. Chosen by a panel of judges, approved by
the CEC Executive sponsor Dan Berg, will review blogs for:

>

>   * Wow factor: Does the blog incorporate technology in unique ways? Is it
fun to read?

>   * Is this a blog that will last throughout the year?

>

Sweet, I have incorporated technology in an interesting and or unique way and
I am fun to read.
