[![One Laptop Per
Child](http://pics.ebaystatic.com/aw/pics/xogiving/g1g1/logo_v2.jpg)](http://www.laptop.org/en/index.shtml)  
  
Donated to One Laptop Per Child at [Laptop
Giving](http://www.laptopgiving.org/en/index.php "Give One Get One" ) so I
will be getting an [XO Laptop](http://www.laptopgiving.org/en/explore.php
"Explore The XO" ) which I think should stand up nicely to having friends with
kids over. Although I will surely have to take it to the office or out on the
town. I wonder how functional I could be using it for work.

> The mission of the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) movement is to ensure that
all school-aged children in the developing world are able to engage
effectively with their own personal laptop, networked to the world, so that
they, their families and their communities can openly learn and learn about
learning.

>  
>

>

> The OLPC Association focuses on designing, manufacturing, and distributing
laptops to children in lesser developed countries, initially concentrating on
those governments that have made commitments for the funding and program
support required to ensure that all of their children own and can effectively
use a laptop.

> Initial focus is on the launch of the One Laptop per Child program. In the
future, the OLPC Foundation will focus on the grassroots, #8220bottom-up#8221
aspects of the OLPC mission.

[Give One Get One](http://www.laptopgiving.org/en/index.php "Give One Get One"
): 15 days left to Order/Donate one yourself.  
  
> If you live in the USA or Canada, and during a brief period of time, you
will be able to pay USD 399 for two XO laptops. The first laptop is yours to
keep (the get 1 part) and the second one is donated to the program to be
distributed in one of OLPC's partner countries (the give 1 part).

The G1G1 program also includes [1 year of T-Mobile Hot Spot
access](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20071102005824&newsLang=en).
If you don't give away the 1 you get you can set up shop at any T-Mobile
HotSpot with your distinctive laptop and be a living advertisement for the
OLPC project.
