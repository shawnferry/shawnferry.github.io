title: A very soft relaunch

Having imported all of my old blog entries from blogs.sun.com and the few I added to blogger, I'm getting started again after 1887 days of non-blogging.

Here's to hoping that simple static pages on github giving me the ability to write clean markdown lets the act of blogging just get out of the way. 

Or maybe this will be the embarassing post that sits around until the next next relaunch.

I expect I'll be blogging about Puppet, OpenStack, Beer, and other random musings. It may be mostly beer.

Eventually when I have at least a bit more styling I'm planning on replacing the old stagnant content on blog.shawnferry.com with this same generally identical content.
