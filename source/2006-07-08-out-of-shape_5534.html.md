Went for a ride yesterday, the first in a few weeks or so and the longest this
year...sad.  
  
~42 miles at ~14.5mph, need to get a new battery for my computer.  
  
I am not in shape for [Hero of the Day](http://www.herooftheday.org) a 250
mile ride  September 15-17 from Warrenton, NC to Washington, DC.  
  
9 weeks to the start, 2 weeks of vacation in the middle and standard training
to a Century is 9 weeks.  
So a Century will be fine but the rest will probably be a bit more work.  
  
Need to get more time in the saddle.
