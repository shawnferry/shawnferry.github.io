During last night's Twitter "[Timeline Oddity
Update](http://blog.twitter.com/2008/02/timeline-oddity-update.html)" I caught
some interesting comments from @bhlackey and @thinguy in response to an update
that appeared in my stream. I won't reproduce it here.

I experienced the following behavior while trying to logout so I could create
the @smutr twitter account.  

403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill
it. I call it lock-in
