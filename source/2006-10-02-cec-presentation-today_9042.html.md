When I woke up this morning I couldn't talk.  
  
I don't talk alot.  
(I know that people will disagree)  
  
Or given the chance I will talk for quite some time...just normally not over
the volume of a bar.  
  
I spent an hour in the bathroom steaming myself.  
  
So if you are here and you come to see our presentation. Sorry, I will be a
bit rough.
