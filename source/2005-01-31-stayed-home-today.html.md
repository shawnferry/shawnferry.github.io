So I stayed home today to make up for working all weekend.  
  
Instead of getting a lot of packing done, I worked while my fiance(who  
gave me -grief- gentile mocking about not originally accenting the e)  
packed up boxes and moved furniture.  
  
It was a nice idea. Unfortunately around 2pm some customer issues  
basically kept me at my computer until about 10:30.  
  
Thankfully my mother came down to help out, otherwise my fiance who was  
not at all pleased by my inability to help would have been a real mess.  
(As she says she only gave me minimal grief for it, because she is  
*awesome*)  
  
I did take a break for lunch and to cary some heavy boxes and stuff out  
to the storage units.  
  
Then after I stopped doing "work" we packed up some more.  
  
"store-to-door":http://storetodoor.com/ is amazingly convenient. We had  
them drop of three units on Saturday, Loaded them up over the last three  
days and they are picking them up -tomorrow- today.  
  
When we move we will call them they will drop them off at the new house  
and come pick them up when we are done.  
  
We may actually get a few more before we are done, not having to load  
out the whole house in one go is great.  
  
Not having to pack out the house, then pack into a storage unit and  
reverse that process when we are done is even better.
