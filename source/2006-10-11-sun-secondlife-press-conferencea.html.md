Disappointed, I forgot to set an alarm so I ended up getting online about 8
minutes after the start.  
  
When I got there I couldn't get into the Sun Pavilion. I was told when I tried
to get in directly that the space was invalid.  
[Stacia](http://blogs.sun.com/stacia) and [Doug](http://toombs.us/) tried to
invite(teleport me in), but they got parcel is full messages.  
When they finally could invite me I got the following error.

On the plus side, I guess this means it was popular enough to fill up quickly.  
  
I did get told to shove off by a female avatar in mime wearing a shirt but no
pants.  
(although I am guessing that it was really all rendering problems not really
someone in mime, that and the use of words)  
  
So the message is mixed, for Stacia, it worked and was cool, she could hear
the conference and I think see the video.  
Doug was unable to hear the streaming audio and when directed to the
instructions board he was unable to get it to resolve.  
(Some items in SL are out of focus, I would guess to save bandwidth, when you
look at them the come into focus)  
  
It seems to me that we may need a teleport area for business purposes. After I
teleported in, I was standing around for about two minutes with only a shirt
on. No hair, no pants.  While the thought of virtual streaking the conference
amuses me I think it might not be the best idea.  
  
Now while we are waiting for people to join, as opposed to getting on a con
call, we need to wait for a couple of minutes after they are in to have pants
on before they can come in.  
  
I wonder if you can code objects to reject avatars not in pants (assuming that
pants are the generic name for lower body clothing)  
  
Note the mocking...that there in the center, that is where you want to be.  
See that tiny little arrow, you are way over there.
