I really like my PowerBook, but it is now ~4 years old and I  
continually try to do more things concurrently than I have quite enough  
memory and processors for. I also really like Solaris, given a new  
MacBook Pro I would use Parallels  and Run Solaris as well,  
but I would  
like to still use the PowerBook for something.  
  
In the near future, within the next 6 months, I will be purchasing a  
new laptop. A 15" or 17" MacBook Pro, sooner if Core 2 Duo (

available.  
  
Running OpenSolaris on my PowerBook will rock.
