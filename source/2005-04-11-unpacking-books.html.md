I just unpacked a fair number of boxes of books. Both in my office and  
onto the bookshelves in the "library" It appears that we need more  
bookshelves, I think two layers, one built in, one half layer on tracks  
and a rolling ladder sounds about right. Then again, maybe not this  
decade, but it is a fun thought. Currently the organizational method has  
been pick up book put on shelf. That will probably need to change at some  
point, but not today, maybe around the time when the books aren't two deep.
