The price on the [  
Ultra 20](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/freeopteronworkstation/index.html) looks
really good.  

I really want:  

A [v20z](http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/v20z), [  
v210 ](http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/v210/)and a [  
3510](http://www.sun.com/storage/workgroup/3000/3500/3510/index.xml)  
  
Actually two each of the servers wouldn't be bad except for the fan  
noise and the power. All of my old equipment (more than 20% of my  
current power bill) could be consolidated onto a v20z with plenty of  
room to spare.
