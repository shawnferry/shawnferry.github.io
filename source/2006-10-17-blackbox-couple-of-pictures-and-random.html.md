The Blackbox concept is cool, as has been said, I would love to have one at
home :)  
Although the power bill, even at the reduced consumption from T2000s would be
a bit much for my home power budget.  
So really, if anyone would like to send me a
[T2000](http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&cmdViewProduct_CP&catid=148746)
and some storage, maybe a
[5320](http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&cmdViewProduct_CP&catid=149155)
and an
[x4200](http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&cmdViewProduct_CP&catid=138713)  
  
Members of the Grid Engineering Team have been working on this project for a
while.  
Internally we have had a couple of discussions about how to work Managed
Operations into the deployment automatically (everything comes with services
now). So what I want now is to get my hands on one operationally.  
  
So the following picture I am posting, not because it was the most technically
interesting one that I saw  
there were plenty of other technically interesting photos, I liked the lines
and the partial reflection of the photographer.

This picture I am posting because...well, seriously.  It seems to me that we
may be pushing this example just a little.

So can someone tell me who will be hooking up the water?  
  
Here because I figure people might want to see an actual Blackbox
