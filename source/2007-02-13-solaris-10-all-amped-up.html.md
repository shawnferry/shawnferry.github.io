The latest news in
[(S/L)AMP](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/amp/index.html "Solaris AMP
page" ) system is pre-built packaged
[coolstack](http://cooltools.sunsource.net/coolstack/ "Coolstack Download/Info
Site" ) software. To quote the coolstack site discussing compile time
optimization "This results in anywhere between 30-200% performance improvement
(depending on workload/application) over standard binaries." To which I say
WOOT!  
  
I have to say Solaris AMP or AMPS. SAMP really doesn't do it for me.

In other vaguely related news, I saw mail recently that PHP 5.5 should be
available by default in OpenSolaris some time soon.  

Also if you are quick about it, it appears that you can have a DVD of the
latest [SXDE (Solaris Express Developer
Edition)](http://developers.sun.com/solaris/downloads/solexpdev/) sent to you
for free. The DVD includes the Solaris AMP packages (so does the download) so
you don't have to get them separately.  

I am currently one rev prior to the SXDE release in my parallels instance, I
guess I should start downloading a new iso.
