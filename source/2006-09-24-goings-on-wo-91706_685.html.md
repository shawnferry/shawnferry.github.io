Last week was quite busy, and at the moment I am not even sure why.  
  
I can look back and figure it out but off hand, I just don't know.  

Two weeks ago I deployed OpenGrok for on the Managed Operations CVS/SVN
server, I have been puttering about with an entry describing my results and
experience for at least the last week. I hope to finish it up and get it
posted in a couple of days.  

We had a film crew on site shooting a marketing video, I worked myself into a
couple of shots. I see a cutting room floor in my future.  

We had (still have) a couple of conference rooms full of IMs and CDE from APAC
for training.  

[Peter Weber](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/bios/bios-weber.html) had his
staff onsite as well, the office and basically all of the conference rooms
were packed.  

In my spare time on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I played with and paniced a
[Sun Fire X4500(a.k.a. Thumper)](http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4500/). Much
in the vein of my previous [what not to do with your lab
boxes](http://blogs.sun.com/yakshaving/entry/what_not_to_do_with) post. After
creating a 7.4TB fully protected zfs pool I started writing a 7TB file
removing disks with cfgadm until I went from a [degraded
state](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5461/6n7ht6qsp?a=view) to a system
panic when it became impossible to safely and sanely write data to the volume.
Quite neat actually, after the system rebooted all of the volumes were intact
and resilvered automatically. This week I am hopefully going to try writing
data directly to some disks to see [data corruption
detection](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5461/6n7ht6qt1?a=view#gbcuz)
in action then maybe zfs send/recv before we have to give it back.  

Went for a ride on Thursday afternoon. The weather was fabulous mid 60s and
sunny. About 20 Miles at 13.5 MPH with a coworker. We should have four or so
this week, we have decided that Thursday afternoons are for group rides.  

Saturday we went to an SCA event and helped out in the kitchen cooking a feast
for 80 or so people.  

Sunday we went to the [Maryland Renaissance
Festival](http://www.rennfest.com/) with some friends (It was pirate weekend,
many Jack Sparrows were sited) and a 22:45 hockey game that didn't start until
23:15.  

Next week: CEC 2006
