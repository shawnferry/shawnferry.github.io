Apparently streaming audio while connecting to a VPN might be a generally  
bad idea. It seems that changing all of your routes and DNS configurations  
may have a detrimental impact on the function of your system. My guess is  
that if I had waited instead of screwing around it would have resolved  
itself, probably in about the time it takes to timeout a DNS request.
