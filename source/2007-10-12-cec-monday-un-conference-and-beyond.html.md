After the un-conference was officially over some of us sat around with James
Baty for another 30-45min. After Jim left @timkennedy, @edsai, James Dean and
I sat around talking for another 30 min. Once they were done breaking down the
room Tim, Ed and I were in the way so we went to the CEC Pavilion and
continued talking before heading off to bed.

Again I say this is how a conference is supposed to be, at Moscone they kick
us out at 9 and disperse to bars or hotels or whatever. No way this type of
thing happens at last years CEC.
