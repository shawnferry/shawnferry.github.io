Went for my first bike ride this year. I came home a little early (or for  
a very late lunch) and actually stopped working before it was dark out. At  
about 5:45 I finally got out of my chair and located all of my bike stuff.  
Fortunately I had a couple of jerseys hung in my closet and shorts in a  
box in the bedroom. The helmets were sitting on the kitchen table and my  
bike shoes, and a patch kit were in a box in the garage cleverly labeled  
"bike stuff + junk", I grabbed a small pump from my camel back and my  
water bottle and off I went. Ended riding just over 10 miles @ 12.89mph  
max 25 The first five miles as usual were the worst, I rode a mile in a  
partial loop around the neighborhood then headed over to the office. Total  
distance for the first leg was 5.18 miles, It sucked. I started off  
strong, a bit too strong for not having done any real cardiovascular type  
activity in months. ~15mph for the first .25 and then ave ~18-20 for the  
next .5 or so At the end of the first mile instead of heading back into  
the neighborhood I struck out for the office at a moderate middle distance  
pace. 4 miles later at the back door of the office I had forgotten my key  
card, since I hadn't finished my water I rested for a minute and headed  
back. The trip back was much better, the warmup on the way out and better  
pace control left me at home feeling quite good. Next time I need to grab  
a light if I am leaving so late. That ~4mile commute is really going to  
kill me.
