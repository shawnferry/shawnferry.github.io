Last Sunday we had a 23:15 game. The latest slot available. I got home about
1:30 as the game started on time.  

We won 4-0 rather a suprise given the historical performance of the team.

Although we have been better this season. Last time we played them we won 12-1
but they didn't have an actual goalie.

As for boring and healthy. C- and I are on a diet (Jenny Craig...we are buying
the food for now. It is amazing how small a reasonable portion of food is) We
are both down ~7lbs in two weeks but that is expected to taper off. We will
see, if we keep up the walking (~8mi), biking (a short 20mi) and Aerobic
activity (Diva Fit or Ice Hockey) we may continue at a good pace.

As an unrelated note I tried posting this through the roller web interface
with blazer on a treo 700p.

Not too bad but I have a feeling that it hurt my flow a bit. Well that and the
part where I can't actually submit it.
