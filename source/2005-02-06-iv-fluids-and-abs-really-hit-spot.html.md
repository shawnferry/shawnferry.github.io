So I went to my local urgent care facility Saturday morning, after  
expirencing some dizziness apparently this was probably due to sinus  
congestion.  
  
With a slight rattle in my chest, a cough, and fluffy green phlegm the  
doctor decided that I would benefit from a liter of fluid and some  
anti-biotics.  
  
I think he was correct, I felt much better today. At least until I got  
some calls from the office. Talking on the phone for extended periods  
made my throught itcy and scratchy again.  
  
5 days left in this course of ABs, if things keep up I should be all  
better. Now for cough medicine and sleep.
