Andy B: On new HPC, Galaxy and such  

Galaxy 2, Andromeda...lots of stuff I can't talk abou because  
I am not sure which bits are public...however cool, massive performance  
enhancements with technology updates.  

In short thought, higher density, smaller form factor. We  
should see be seeing more cool new things inside the next year or so.  
  
(This is probably a forward looking statement. There is some big legal  
statement about that, so I wouldn't buy any stock based on my  
particular interpretation of what I am hearing)  

TiTECH Facts: From hardware delivery to benchmark 30 days #7  
on the top 500.  

New NSF Grid has a basic overview that looks similar to the  
Sun Grid design (in a very high level block diagram slide kind of way)  

Q: Why FBDIMMs  
  
A: In the end that may be a mistake.  

SMS comment: Andy B speaks without any latency. When will he  
take a breath? What clock speed is he on? He should look at decaf!  
  
Big laughs and clapping all around.  

Dan and guy I don't know on sight...no intro slide(I bet you I  
should know who he is): Future  

Guy I don't Know:  

Next -- SOA, Grid, Dynamic Inf., Web 2.0  
(interactive/parcipitory)  

Why --  
  
Smaller interfaces, cellphones, set tops, etc.  

Examples --  
  
Grey Album -&gt; EMI supression -&gt; EMI notices success  
-&gt; Hires DJ Dangermounse -&gt; Wins Producer of the Year for  
Gorillaz' Demon Days  

What --  
  
Sell solutions

_My Interpretation:  
  
_

New flexible business models, we don't know what the next new  
big organic growth thing will be.  
  
Flexibility to adapt to provide for the next thing without knowing what  
it is now.  

(His name is Jim...but only becuase Dan said "Thanks Jim")  

Dan: Internal Resources  

People have been saying that we don't know what all of the  
available communities are to let people help themselves.  
  
Dan went into a bit on Customer Engineering Programs
