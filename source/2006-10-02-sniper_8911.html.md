C-'s brother was shot by a sniper today in Iraq.  

Fortunately he is OK.  

The shot hit the buckle of his armor and disintegrated, sending shrapnel into
his face.  
  
Fortunately safety goggles work and the damage is apparently not too bad.  

Otherwise a fraction of an inch difference and he would be dead.  
  
Apparently there have been number of attempts recently and he is the least
hurt of the survivors.
