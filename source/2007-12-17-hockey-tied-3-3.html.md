Our team remains undefeated, for the first time since EVER. Our record is now
2-0-4. We knew that we were going to be down a some players and we had a
substitute goalie which made for some excitement all around.  
  
I was a bit tired and sore from the race on Saturday morning and we ended up
with a lighter than expected turnout. Aside from the stamina issues I think it
worked fairly well as a recovery exercise. A prophylactic dose of IB about an
hour before the game and some hard skating seems to have loosened me up
nicely.  
  
I can still feel the race a bit in my legs, yesterday felt like I was riding
big hills on my bike. Today feels like I rode some big hills on my bike a
while ago.
