Interesting problem... At boot the Secondary boot loader repeatably  
panicked with a [  
Nonexistant
Diskette0](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/yakshaving/20050402#nonexistant_diskette01)
error. Not to give up easily I decided to try with  
the express b72 nbp and inetboot image. I still see the error, but I don't  
get the panic. Now the problem is instead of running my custom Jumpstart  
it is running interactive. However in the grand scheme of things,  
installing by hand will be much faster than trying to install by thinking  
hard and cheaper than buying an external firewire CD/DVD.
