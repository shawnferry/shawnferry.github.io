Publishing test from docs.google.com  
  
Paul [posted](http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/how_to_post_to_blogs "How to
post from docs.google.com" ) not too long ago about publishing to
blogs.sun.com from docs.google.com.  
  
I am giving it a shot, I have been using ecto for posting and I like it a lot.  
  
However I am less pleased with it's HTML editing, or RTF to HTML as rendered
by default  
on b.s.c.  
  
So at the moment I am editing HTML in Nvu, which is working well, however I am
trying  
docs.google.com for HTML editing to see how I like it instead.  
  
Nvu does a great job at HTML editing, but it is more feature rich that I feel
that I need  
in general for blog posts.  I also find that I am online the majority of the
time while I am  
composing blog entries.  
  
Again it seems that almost everything goes back to the current capacity of my
laptop, but  
if I can do most(all) of this in a browser interface that I don't hate, why
not.  
  
Now to see how timing is working, Paul commented that there were issues with
time offsets.  
  
I am having similar problems using Ecto, I thought I had it mostly worked out
but instead  
every post I publish is way off in time. At some point I will revisit that,
but for now I am  
logging in and modifying the time for every post.  
  
Well, here goes.  
  
Edit:  
well, the post was 6 hours in the future  
Now to see if I can publish an update, of if this will go in as a separate
post.  
  
Edit 2: Good news and bad news  
Good News: "re-publish" acts as an update, not a new post  
Bad News: It resets the publish time to now+6 hours  
  
(now to publish again and manually edit the time (again))  
  
Impressions:  
It works AND the HTML is not an ugly mess  
If it comes down to it I can copy and paste HTML as I was before  
I may continue to use docs.google.com to write entries, particularly since
etco fetches them after they are posted.  
  
Edit 3: Lame  
One thing I just noticed is that the posted HTML (as opposed to the editor
displayed HTML)  
is posted as all one line. It doesn't hurt the rendering at all, but does make
it significantly  
harder to read the raw HTML once it is posted.  
  
Ecto downloads the HTML in the same fashion (no linebreaks) which indicates to
me that it is  
not a local (blogs.sun.com editor) rendering problem.  
  
Also, I can't figure out how to apply tags from inside the docs.google.com
editor,  
only from the list of documents (and I am not sure how it will work in any
case).  
  
Oops:  
Broke something, I can't publish updates anymore, the blogs.sun.com url
specific  
to this entry no longer appears to be valid (some edit on one side or the
other has  
probably caused it to change) (now updating from ecto)  
  
Edit 'The Last':  
The problem that I have with ecto and line breaks persists, the valid looking
HTML  
is stripping the line breaks. Trying to publish RTF both with local 'convert
line breaks' enabled  
and disabled results in a nice solid block of text. Back to Taking well
formatted HTML  
(from Nvu or docs.google.com) and pasting into ecto. Yet another thing to
spend time on later  
to try and figure out.  
  
Strangely each update I sent with ecto bumped the publish time forward by one
hour,  
not sure what that is about either.
