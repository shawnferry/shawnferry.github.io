Sitting in the Capitol Region OpenSolaris Users Group meeting, this is one of
the best turnouts that e have had so far. This meeting is a little later than
last few (starting after the workday instead of just before the end).

Ooh, live demo failed...looking for a live setup utility for the AMP stack
couldn't find it offhand. OTOH the GUI package manager is working nicely. IPS
seems like it has really made progress since the last time I looked (it has
been a while, I have been slacking). We just got the fairly standard question
about patching, packaging etc looking more advanced in OpenSolaris than
Solaris 10. The answer of course is "OpenSolaris is more the development
platform, it has the newer and more advanced/bleeding edge features. Some of
these features will make it back to commercial Solaris."

Given the location that we are in another fairly obvious question: How do we
get access to these cool bits and the IPS repository if our network is
separated from the internet by an air gap. (The answer is that you can set up
your own repo, eventually you should expect that there will be something like
an official DVD that provides the needed files. (I expect that this is really
only of interest in the Fed space))  

I just remembered why the late meetings here aren't as nice as they could be.
The AC cuts off at 6PM, it is starting to get just a touch warmer in here. I
assume it will be fairly warm by the end of the meeting.  
  
Moved to Sam NIcholson for "OpenSolaris: A Developer's Perspective"

"OpenSolaris Look and Feel: Give people what they expect and slip in what they
need under the covers."  
  
Good questions about iSCSI, SMF, Contracts, manifests. I am surprised at how
few people here haven't done much with SMF (not even writing your own
service).  

I really need to get to ZFS root for the live snapshot based update, I have
the image sitting on my laptop but haven't installed the image.
