Blowing my own horn!

Sunday took and passed the Solaris Certified Network Administrator exam!

Monday took and passed the Solaris Certified Security Administrator exam!

(This one I was really worried about but passed with a 79.7 (or so) score)

I would go take more tests but I already have the S10 admin and I have serious
doubts that I could do anything with the Java or Cluster exams.

It is currently my understanding that only two people have taken the Security
exam so aside from me, Glenn Brunette (of [Glenn Brunette's Security
Blog](http://blogs.sun.com/gbrunett/)) who wrote the exam.
