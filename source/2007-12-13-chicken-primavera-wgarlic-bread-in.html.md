Notes:  
The found "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" expired Feb 13 '07. If you can't
find this vintage feel free to use whatever edible grease you can find. Butter
or butter flavor recommended.  
  
The random spices smell like an Italian blend. They have been allowed to
mellow and blend on the office kitchen table for at least a month.  
  
All times are approximate, a pre-heated toaster oven would clearly require
less time.
