During lunch Radia wandered b our table. I was wearing my xkcd sudo shirt
yesterday and we talked briefly. Jim stopped her to say hello and thank her
again for the session last night. Jim and Radia started talking about one of
the stories from last night (determine the problem before solving it).

We started talking about network protocols and families and children and, and
and. Then we got kicked out of the lunch room so we set up shot in the hallway
for the next 1.5 hours and talked more about network protocols, security
deployments and experience.

It was cool, THIS is what large face to face conferences are about.
Serendipitous meetings and conversations that we have yet to
mimic/facilitate/experience in virtual worlds.

Jim and Radia, identification will be left up to the reader
