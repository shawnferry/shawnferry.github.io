Cascades Firechase 10K (May 29, 2010) race report (Belated)

I had been waiting to see if the finish line photographers had a picture of me
finishing with my mimosa but I can't figure out who they were and just forgot.

I hadn't been planning on running this race a week before North Face but I
decided on Friday that since I was going to be running anyway I may as well
have a supported run with friends. Little did I know that not only was it
going to be hot and humid but this race is know for hills. OTOH I got a couple
Chik-Fil-A Spicy Chicken Sandwiches out of it as post race food.

In brief, it was hot in the low 90s and a bit humid. I got to the start just
as the group was going out for a warmup run. I ended up behind everyone
warming up slow planning on racing at maybe 11:00/mi which in the end was not
to be.  

Immediately prior to the start I let myself get dragged to the front by
Mandana and Atle when I tried to go towards the back the group wouldn't let me
so I started the first 100m at 8 something then moved to the side after the
first corner and slowed down. On and off I ran with various members of the
[Ashburn Area Running Club](http://www.runashburn.org/) watching them slowly
pull away from me while my pace slowly increased until Maureen caught up with
me on the way out of a pit stop. Allowing for hills we were running around
9:40/mi and I pulled ahead a bit after on the hill around mile 5. At 5.9 I
stopped for a mimosa took a gulp and Maureen caught me up moments later.

Crossing the line with a little kick I was holding the mimosa (finding that
the nice rigid plastic cup was hard to drink from on the run), which I
finished a moment later. Much amused by the questioning looks and "What are
you drinking?" I kept the cup next year I may run with it.

[Run Washington has a non-Shawn focused write up as well

Report.htm)

Result: 61:41

I'm sure I could do better, maybe next year I should opt for the bloody mary.
