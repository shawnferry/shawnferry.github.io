John used to be the CIO of SevenSpace, it was interesting to hear his take on
the direction things are going in the management of complex systems and agile
development of services.

Big Sun Managed Operations turnout, we had most of the front stage right
corner and some more dissidents sprinkled in the crowd.

I think there are some really useful things coming out of the field. Didn't
take any notes though, I was charging my laptop.
