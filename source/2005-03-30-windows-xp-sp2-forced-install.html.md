So a friend of mine just sent me a link that seems to indicate that on  
April 12th SP2 will be installed. UPDATE: Time is running out! Please note  
that the mechanism to temporarily disable delivery of Windows XP SP2 is  
only available for a period of 240 days (8 months) from August 16, 2004.  
At the end of this period (after April 12, 2005), Windows XP SP2 will be  
delivered to all Windows XP and Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems. I am  
glad I don't have any devices running windows at home any more.
