While we were in China we spent some time on the Great Wall at Mutianyu. In
the [gallery](http://lalartu.smugmug.com/gallery/4208036/1/245968505) there is
a "You are Here" mark on the

map. We hiked (or more like climbed) from that point to the end (the 20) and
back. You can see un-restored wall at the end.

(FYI: Courtney took the large picture above)
