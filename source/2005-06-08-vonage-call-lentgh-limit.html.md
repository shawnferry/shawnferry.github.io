My calls drop at 4 hours, still no idea where the limitation is  
and no real testing.  

If I can plan for another long call I will try moving the VOIP  
gateway outside the firewall but I can't currently think of a  
limit that would be imposed by the firewall that I wouldn't hit  
with other long running connections like music streaming.  

Maybe I need to try and start a Skype call and let it run for 4  
hours and see if it drops.
