Rode out to the Washington and Old Dominion Trail, then to the rt. 15  
bypass, but I decided to turn around at the top instead of going down and  
under just to go up the other-side a bit to turn around again. From: [  
just past 26.5](http://www.wodfriends.org/map7.html) to [  
just before 33](http://www.wodfriends.org/map5.html) I feel it a bit this
morning, going up the stairs, I could  
tell that I rode yesterday. I also feel it a little in my achilles. I need  
to be a bit more through in my stretching.
