What is [Goose Grade](http://goosegrade.com/)?

Paraphrased from the video and my reading. Crowd-sourced (do people still say
crowd-sourced?) review/editing of blog content. I have added the goose grade
chicklet to my blog. It seems as if it has potential, particularly given my
generally bad grammar/punctuation and spelling.

Suggestions for improvement

  * excerpt post title in goosegrade.com feed
  * excerpt feed needs to link to individual article not top level site
  * excerpt feed needs to ignore non-primary content feeds 
    * alternately allow users to specify/override for the appropriate feed
  * excerpt feed needs to not post errors such as 403 or javascript problems
  * excerpt feed per-article images should be part of the article, not the first/only image on the page

  * excerpt feed I feel no desire to comment on the goosegrade.com site, it doesn't foster or enhance the conversation around a particular post
  * excerpt feed I am unable to see the value in the link to the goosegrade excerpt
  * console sliding animation is attractive but I am unsure that it enhances use
  * console drop downs truncate long site names
  * console/excerpt "Name of site" isn't especially useful as the target of the excerpt link
  * most pages would benefit from a more results/next page link
  * console I would expect website name to link to the user provided URL e.g. "blogs.sun.com/yakshaving" not blogs.sun.com as above, If I had used Yakshaving as the name instead would I have been presented with a broken link?
  * search shawn ferry (no quotes) seems likely to have matched shawnferry, but it doesn't
  * search does not seem to search inside user profile content
  * generated html should include alt and title text to help explain what goosegrade is and why someone might want to click (I made some up)![ ](http://img.skitch.com/20081003-qt6423d21x6fxrp2yabbtqxdi5.png)

Please feel free to give it a shot by clicking on the goosegrade chicklet in
the side bar (or the one I included specifically in this post).
