What?!? A chinposin T-shirt as an external and ongoing display of authority.

Are YOU [chinposin](http://www.chinposin.com/), take a look at the [chinposin
blog](http://chinposin.wordpress.com/) for some explanation of the chinposin
movement straight from the mouth of the chinerati.

[ThinGuy](http://blogs.sun.com/ThinGuy/entry/chin_up_old_chap) posted about
chinposin yesterday, and Friday's are for chinposin! My latest avatar snapped
by my wife (@cdash) this morning. Chinposin doesn't take a description of the
avatar I call this one:  

Authority at rest cannot be STOPPED!

It figures that I was not the only person to go with a chinposin at rest
avatar today, but as far as I can tell I was the only one to actually do it
from bed. This shows that my own natural authority shines through :)
