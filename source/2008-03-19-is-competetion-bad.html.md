Adam said his record for
[Escapa!](http://members.iinet.net.au/~pontipak/redsquare.html) was 16.02 and
I knew I could beat it.  
  
So I did it a few times and figured more of the pattern out. Instead of
claiming some high number I took a screencast of the session. Then after
ending the capture I beat my own time so I took a screenshot.

My best time is now 23.234 and that is (including the time for the video and
blogging this) is 15 minutes of my life that I will never get back. My
question now is how many people will actually watch the video?
