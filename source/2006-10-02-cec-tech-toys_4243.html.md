I have a little sony laptop running a horrendously old version of Solaris 10
Express.  
  
However it works, and it can run punchin(Sun native IPSEC VPN). Punchin rocks,
unfortunately  
I understand that it doesn't work from here even if I could get online.  
  
I have a literal point-to-point, go Gigabit interface automatic cable
detection.  
I am sharing my WiFi connection from my PowerBook to my Sony. I have a custom
ipsec configuration  
that allows my Mac to connect via ssh to the Sony.  
  
In the end what it means is that I can display either with X11 forwarding or
VNC a browser that lets me see  
SWAN.  
  
(However see my can't really connect to the network post as to how that is
working out at the moment)
