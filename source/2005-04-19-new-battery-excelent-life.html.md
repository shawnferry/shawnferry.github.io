For the first time in about 6-9 months my laptop has warned me about  
running on reserve power! Before I replaced the battery at almost exactly  
1 hour of predicted life my laptop would sleep. Now I have had about 2.75  
hours of wireless operations streaming audio running at highest  
performnace and constant 'find /'s to burn power. I expect my laptop to  
sleep any second now, with an estimated 4 minutes of power left, but the  
estimated time appears to be dropping about 1 min for every 90s or so of  
operation. It's like christmas, and I have a new toy. Now I am running at  
%0 power and no estimate of time just "Calculating". Damn, and there goes  
the recycling collection and I didn't take it out. Saving quite often now  
just in case I shutdown instead of sleep. Went to sleep at just over 3  
hours, I am happy.
