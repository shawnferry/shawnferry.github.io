Writing a papers on SLAs and B2B commerce What I was doing...sitting on a  
con call. What I am doing for the next hour...writing papers on SLAs and  
B2B commerce Then getting back on the phone It's good that I have three  
cordless speaker phone capable handsets, I can almost use them  
continuously.
