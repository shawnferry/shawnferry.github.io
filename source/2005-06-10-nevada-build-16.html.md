I downloaded Nevada Build 16 last night. Hopefully I can get things  
together enough to try and rebuild my little laptop this weekend.  
  
Actually I think I will try an upgrade to see if I can get it to work, I  
think I allocated a partition to try live upgrade when I built it.  

I really want to see "New Boot"  
  
Vaguely on that note, if anyone has an external vga connector for a Sony  
PCG-U3 I wouldn't mind if you wanted to send it to me.
