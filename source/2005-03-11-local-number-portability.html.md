I have been a little busy and neglecting my personal mail. In checking  
just now, I see that I have a notification from [  
Vonage](www.vonage.com) that I have a voicemail. I will take that as an
indicator that my  
number transfer to Vonage has gone through. The stated minimum time for  
the transfer was 20 business days, it appears to have gone through on the  
10th. Figuring that getting the request sent late Friday doesn't really  
count as a day, it took 22-23 business days. Part of the HOA fees at the  
new house are for local phone service. Time to setup Asterisk or something  
to route calls between Vonage (basically everything) and the land line  
(911). I understand that Vonage has a basic 911 tie in, but why not use a  
land line with full integration.
