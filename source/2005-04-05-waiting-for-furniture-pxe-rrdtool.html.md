I stayed home this morning waiting for the last piece of furniture that we  
ordered when our style/color was discontinued. The furniture got delivered  
at ~9... Then I didn't get out of the house in time so I got on a 10:00  
call, then while that was going on... I tried to fix my PXE boot problem,  
I think I also needed to remember to change the DHCP macros. Unfortunately  
after redoing the macros the initial kernel that is being loaded by my net  
boot is still b72. I read my mail, RRDtool 1.2rc2 has been released. So I  
downloaded it, compiled it. and got Torrus collecting data. So far so  
good, now to make the changes to apache so I can look at the data. But  
first off to the office so I can deal with my normal triple booked  
12:00-1:30 Tuesday Morning and have a half hour before the meetings start  
again. Tuesdays are basically useless.
