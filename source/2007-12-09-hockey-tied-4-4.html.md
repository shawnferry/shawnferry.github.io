We ended up tied 4-4.  
  
Went down by two in the first, picked up one in the second and three in  
the third.  
  
The tying goal was a screened slapshot from THEIR blue line.  
  
We are doing much better as a team, but we were having issues  
getting the puck out of our zone tonight.  
  
My legs were feeling dead almost from the start, ah well. Need to get back on  
the regular exercise bandwagon.
