Not being a Java programmer this session may not be as useful as I will have
hoped. However many, many, many of my customers are doing more, more and more
java apps.

It will end up that I was correct, this is interesting and good to know, but
it isn't going to be quite as useful for day-to-day and I had hoped it might
be.

OK, DAVE is cool (missed acronym) something like Dtrace Advanced Visualization
Environment. The call tree view...neet. I can see where this would have
immediately pointed to something that we worked our way to and then had to
argue about. (I'm not sure that if we had it we could have run it, but still
cool and the developers could have done it)

JSDT (self defined probes...also cool)
