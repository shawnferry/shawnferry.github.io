In ~20 hours I will be racing the in [Celtic Solstice Five
Miler](http://www.baltimorerunning.com/events/Celtic%20Solstice/Celtic%20Solstice%20winter%20Page.htm)
my wife will be there to cheer and my youngest sister may also be running.  
  
Went up to the community gym last evening, I should do that more often. It
isn't big or equipped with all the latest gear but it has more than enough for
a good workout. Did about a mile warmup, got a good stretch, did another slow
mile, stretched some more and walked home. As a dry run I tried the gortex
biking booties as the ventilation in my shoes has been a little on the chilly
side. The booties are OK, but they are C-'s 41/42 and I wear 45s, they didn't
bother me and I noticed a decrease in chilly feet on my walk to and from the
gym.  
  
Weather.com says Baltimore will have a "Fitness Comfort Index of 2 (where 3-1:
Uncomfortable)" Mostly Cloudy to Cloudy with predicted temperatures of 30F
feels like 20F. It should be fun, except for the getting up early to drive up
for the race.
