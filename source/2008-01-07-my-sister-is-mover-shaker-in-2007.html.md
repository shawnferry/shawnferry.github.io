My younger sister just sent out a link to the BroadwayWorld.com article
[Movers & Shakers: 46 Artists of the 2007 Baltimore
Theatre](http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=23961) by [James
Howard](http://www.broadwayworld.com/author.cfm?authorid=72) she is listed as
a part of the "The Masters Class of 2007".

> Just as there are "new faces" every year, so too are there familiar names
and faces that have been sharing their expertise and love for theatre with
local audiences for years. Here, in alphabetical order, are the 10 men and 10
women who really distinguished themselves onstage or behind the scenes this
year, even surpassing their already monumental achievements.

> Karina Ferry (The Mineola Twins, Angels in America: Perestroika, The Great
American Trailer Park Musical): My first brush with Karina Ferry was when she
replaced another actress in a production of And Then There Were None. She was
so good, that both she and the other actress were named Outstanding Actress
for the same role last year. She continued her excellent work this year in The
Mineola Twins, in a supporting role, but nothing prepared me for her next two
performances. First, she gave a gutsy, all-out performance as the drug-addled
Harper in Angels in America: Perestroika at Spotlighters, then dazzled us at
the same venue with her best trailer trash shtick in The Great American
Trailer Park Musical. Ms. Ferry has been on the Baltimore scene for some time,
but this year she took her skills to a whole new level.

My sister doesn't read this blog but I think that it is cool even though I
won't remember to tell her that in person.
