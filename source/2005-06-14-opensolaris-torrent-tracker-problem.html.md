I had been seeding the OpenSolaris when I started getting errors about  
most of the torrents from the tracker.  

If you are having problems getting everything except opensolaris-src...  
then it would appear to be the same issue.  

Although while I was writing this demand for the single file has  
increased.

Edit: I restarted everything again when I got home. Naturally after I  
say something they all started working. It appears I forgot to publish  
this update, things have been working fully since around 19:00 Eastern
