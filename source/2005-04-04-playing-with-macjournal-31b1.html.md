I have been using [ ](http://homepage.mac.com/dschimpf/>MacJournal</a> as a
blogging client. So far I generally like it.    Living on the bleeding edge,
this is my first post using 3.1b1.   I only have one real issue, but I think
that I can't really blame it on any one thing.  I generally use the <a
href=)textism.com/tools/textile"&gt;Textile: A  
Humane Web Text Generator text processing plugin for roller. However it  
looks like it is not applied when posting with the Roller xml-rpc API. At  
the moment I am just logging in selecting the formatter and reposting each  
entry. Even with the extra step I generally like this more than editing in  
the web interface.
