I just submitted our presentation, that was due today. (A couple of hours ago
now)  

With time to spare!  

We really should have made time to do this earlier and saved ourselves some
pain.  

Now: Going to bed while my wife organizes the fight against a firewall
problem.  

Note: Shouldn't have stayed up till 3am fooling around with graphs, got them
done much faster  
  
today after sleeping. Also [RRDTool Rocks](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/)
(Still)  

Next: Sleep, Presentation Review
