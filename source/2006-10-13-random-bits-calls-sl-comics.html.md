All morning on calls, part of the afternoon as well  
  
Came into the office to start updating my little laptop to snv_50 (from 18).  
Spent a lot of time talking to people about work but not getting any
noticeable work done.  
  
Now off to meet my family for my mother's birthday.  
One of those busy all day, not even sure why types.  
  
Playing in SL last night while doing things about the house. I am trying to
build  
a jukebox. I have some basic structure and next will be sound before much more  
effort in terms of appearence.  
  
xkcd has entertaining comics, and T-shirts. [xkcd - Turn Back - By Randall
Munroe](http://xkcd.com/c170.html)  
  
For example this, available on a T-shirt, which I own.
