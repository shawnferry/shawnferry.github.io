I talked briefly about the [  
Solaris 10 Beta
Exams](http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/beta.html) in [  
Beta Exam Part
1](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/yakshaving/20050317#solaris_10_beta_exam_part)
and [  
Thoughts on Beta Exam Part

Now I am off for part two. Yesterday a  
co-worker and I both took part one at the same time, we talked about it a  
bit [  
last night](

and we both feel that we probably did reasonably well. He was  
going to sign up to take part two today as well, but the schedule was  
already full (I think he just wants some feedback to know if he should  
focus on any specific technology areas for his test next week :) ). I  
don't feel nearly as well prepared for this part. Nothing is really new to  
me, but it is technology that I have used more at home than in a day to  
day work environment. I will keep everyone informed as to how many surveys  
I take this time, and if in the end if I could have used more than four  
hours to complete the test.
