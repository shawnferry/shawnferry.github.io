I recently wrote a [parody
post](http://blogs.sun.com/yakshaving/entry/air_passengers_could_be_tagged)
where I took some text from a [livestock tracking supply
company](http://www.rfidtagstcc.com/) and changed it to talk about people
instead of catlle. It was written in response to a [BBC article on RFID
tagging at airports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6044310.stm).  
  
Unveiling the study, EU commissioner Viviane Reding said citizens needed re-
assuring that radio tags would not lead to large-scale surveillance.  

My concern here is really not so much large scale surveillance, although to
some extent I worry about it. My true concern is from the identity/privacy
standpoint, and the possibilty of remote undetected reading of the data on the
tag.

interesting/thought provoking:
