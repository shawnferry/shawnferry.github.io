Friday the 23rd of October was our 5th wedding anniversary, since we were
planning on staying in the city overnight I packed to run in the morning.
Shortly before we left the house I got a last minute opportunity to run the
Army 10 Miler which I accepted. That evening the Caps defeated the Thrashers 4
to 3, we went to the Irish Channel Pub stayed had a late dinner and drinks
made our way back to the hotel and eventually got to sleep.

After a brief sleep a convenient but uneventful metro ride to the start I got
a bib, dropped off my bag and headed to the start. This is the largest race I
have ever run and the mass of people was impressive. As a last longer taper
run before Marine Corps I tried to keep my pace to a very easy recovery pace
and note the parts of the course that coincide with MCM, in particular the
14th street bridge.

I enjoyed the easy run noticing a bit of heaviness in my legs, a bit of a
hangover and felt the lack of sleep. For the last few miles starting on the
14th street bridge I began increasing the pace picking up slowly to my goal
marathon pace for the last mile and a half or so. The pace felt OK, the effort
seemed to be about what I was expecting for that point in the race. I finished
in 1:43:38 a reasonable but unchallenging result.
