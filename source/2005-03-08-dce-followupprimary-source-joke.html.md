My primary source joke made me curious. Fortunately the [  
Oxford Reference Online](http://www.oxfordreference.com/) backs me up, even in
spanish.

> 3\. DCE Abbrev. for  
>  data communication equipment. The side of an interface that represents  
>  the provider of a data communication in a standard such as RS232C or X25.  
>  DCEs are usually analog or digital modems or network interface units.  
>  Compare DTE . (From A Dictionary of Computing in Computing)

> 4\. DCE  
>  Computing data-communications equipment (From The Oxford Dictionary of  
>  Abbreviations in English Language Reference)

>

> 5\. DCE abbr ( data  
>  communications equipment ) equipo de comunicaci√É¬≥n de datos m (From The  
>  Oxford Business Spanish Dictionary (English-Spanish) in Bilingual
