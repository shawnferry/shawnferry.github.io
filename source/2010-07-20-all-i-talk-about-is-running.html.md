It seems that all I talk about recently is running and all the pictures are
related to running. I guess I'm mostly OK with that I'm still doing plenty of
work but I'm not finding quite the angle to talk about it.

I'm currently sitting here eating a late lunch waiting for a SNMP event from a
device to debug the handling since previous events from this one source
apparently have gone missing.

Briefly, SNMP -&gt; custom trap sink -&gt; event parser. I'm sitting in front
of the whole stack waiting for packets with debugging enabled.
