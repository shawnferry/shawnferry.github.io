I slacked off on my blogging after CEC. It was a busy time, then I got lazy,
then holidays and a nice stomach bug.  
  
However since CEC I have gotten a new laptop installed Parallels and Solaris
11 (OpenSolaris/Nevada) that makes for plenty of blog fodder.  
  
In the relatively near future I should be blogging about:  

  1. Solaris in Parallels
  2. More Solaris in General
  3. More with the Creating SMF services
    * Particularly my future plans to consolidate some of the services I created now that I have a better feeling for what I want
  4. Some of the cool things I have been espousing to our Tier I staff about screen

In other news the Washington Capitals won 3-2 in overtime against the Atlanta
Thrashers!  
As my wife would say "We won, We won, We won, We won" only it is singsong and
happy.
