We won 5 - 0, I got the game winning goal and an assist. Now I'm not really
tired it will make for a long day tomorrow.  
  
I left for the game right after we finished watching the NHL All Stars, I
enjoyed the game. All in all it was a really hockey weekend. On Saturday we
drove up to Hershey, PA for a Bears game (The Caps Farm team). We got in a
little late and they were down 3 - 0 against the Senators.  
  
In the end the Bears won 5 - 3, we hung out after the game for some
autographs, talked to some of the players it was a nice day even if the drive
home seemed a little long.  
  
Slept in this morning (felt great) before doing some work around the house.
@cdash and I pulled out the dish washer to insulate behind it, put new casters
on an ottoman and tore up some defiled carpet and molding.  
  
Now I have a two week break and a nice early 11:15 game (the latest possible
slot) on a Monday.  
  
In the end it was a good weekend but I'll pay for it in the morning. I think
there may be a bit of Wii Lego Starwars in my future.
