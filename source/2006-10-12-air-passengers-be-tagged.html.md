Not quite security theater, maybe not at all, but I can't say that the idea of
tagging everyone in  
an airport with RFID chips appeals to me at all. (Or really that the idea of
tagging everyone with RFID chips anywhere appeals to me)  

Dr Paul Brennan, an electrical engineer, is leading the tagging project, known
as Optag.  
He said: "The basic idea is that airports could be fitted with a network of
combined panoramic cameras and RFID (radio frequency ID) tag readers, which
would monitor the movements of people around the various terminal buildings."  

A noted issue that has to be addressed is "ensuring the tags cannot be
switched between passengers or removed without notification",  
we may have the answer to that problem already in hand.  Someone should
purchase stock in ear piercing parlors.

#  Age and Source Verification Necessary For Public Safety, Consumer
Confidence

The future of the security is headed toward global identification and source
verification of origin of all types of Personnel and usage of electronic
identification systems to help with disease tracking and to improve public
safety. Our rfid ear tags are International Standards Organization(ISO)
compliant and we offer Full Duplex(FDX) and Half Duplex(HDX) transponders as
well as high temperature RFID tags. The Company is in the process of becoming
an authorized tag reseller to help  surveillance organizations integrate
electronic identification with the National Security Identification System and
Management System. The NSIS will oversee the implementation of a National EID
system for many types of animals including Personnel, beef and dairy cattle,
swine, sheep, goats, elk, alpacas and llamas.

**Electronically tagging passengers at airports could help the fight against terrorism, scientists have said.**

However if you have need of livestock tagging equipment and such I am sure
they would be glad to help you
