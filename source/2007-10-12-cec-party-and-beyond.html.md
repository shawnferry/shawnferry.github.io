The party was interesting, the space was nearly big enough but the ability to
move was constrained by the shape of the spaces.

A party in three parts:

The pool: Big hit, weather was really nice. Women dancing on platforms on the
pool, RC boats running around the pool, piles of CEC attendees standing around
the pool, live band. Long lines.

Inside, downstairs: Eh, dark, loud. Everyone was packing the pool side so
lines inside (particularly upstairs) were non-existent when I was there. Easy
access to taquitos wasn't especially engaging. We also had a briefly
interesting but overall uninspiring Kill Bill interpretive dance also some
disappointing fire play (I am spoiled).

Little Buddha: Apparently there was sushi, I got a couple of pieces from the
on the run guy, he would barely slow down to let you get anything. Couldn't
find any of the carry out type boxes with food in them, no idea what they
were. Dessert was tasty but I am not sure how the baklava relates to the sushi
theme. Really tasty whipped peanut butter tart things (if you like peanut
butter). I took one picture it wasn't so good.

The final I am sometimes a negative person verdict: music was to loud (always
is) forgot my earplugs, party wasn't bad but it was somewhat hard to navigate.
Got some good pictures of the dancing (sure to be a hit based on the long term
ogling around the pool).

After the party we went back to the hotel had a drink and cigar at Napoleon's
then on to an "outdoor" cafe/stage at paris.
