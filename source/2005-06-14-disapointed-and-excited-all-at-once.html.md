I downloaded snv_16 which is not quite as uptodate as the downloadable  
OpenSolaris code.  

PXE booting to a grub menu was really way too cool!  

Not getting an address for the actual boot was lame and now not being  
able to repeat anything except dhcp not working it is disapointing.  

I was hoping to get snv_16 installed tonight and start compiling  
OpenSolaris tomorrow.  

Taking one last look at my configuration shows that somehow I lost the  
client idnetifier for my statically assigned DHCP address. I have  
re-modified the entry and it is time for another shot.
