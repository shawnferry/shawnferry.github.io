It is going to be a heavy trip. Last year I brought the small camera. This
year, I am going whole hog.

  * Laptop 
    * FW iSight
    * External HD (need the speed and storage)
  * Cannon S70
  * Nikon D1x 
    * three fast (heavy) lenses
    * four batteries (the just don't last like they used to)
    * flash
    * tripod? (probably not)
  * tiny wireless router (useful in hotel if access is wired only)

On the down side, @cdash and I both just got vaccinated for:  

  1. flu
  2. Hep A
  3. Hep B

My shoulders are a bit sore. I can't wait to get my tetanus booster on
Thursday shortly after I get off the red eye home. China here we come.

Clothes are all packed, heading to the Caps season opener in a few hours and
getting up to meet people at 0500 for breakfast at IHOP before the flight.
