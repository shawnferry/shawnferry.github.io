It's not quite like I haven't been posting since CEC 2006 although it sure
feels like it. I have been suffering from too many ideas with not enough focus
to get through them.

This may well be a resolution to start blogging more again if for no other
reason than to try and climb over lskrocki and thinguy in the blog rankings
even briefly :)

We head to China on vacation for two weeks the week after CEC there may be
internet cafe's with keyboards I can't read in my near future.

(also testing from the ecto 3.0 alpha)
