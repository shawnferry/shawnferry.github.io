I recently got a message from Craig Bender over at
[ThinGuy](http://blogs.sun.com/ThinGuy/ "Sun Ray Blog" ) informing me that my
blog wasn't rendering so well in IE, but that it worked fine in FireFox. Not
having anything running windows I tried my phone which displayed similar
problems (Blazer on a Treo).

It appears that I had an extra &lt;/div&gt; but that is fixed now. The title
banner still looks bad in Blazer, but it stops where it is supposed to now.

Thanks Craig.
