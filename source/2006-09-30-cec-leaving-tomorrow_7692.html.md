Getting on a plane to SFO tomorrow for CEC.  

I should start packing any time now.  

Decide which Camera(s) to take...Should I bring the D1x or just the point and
shoot (and the camerphone)?  
  
If I bring the D1x, I should stop with the yakshaving and clean it; I have a
dusty sensor.  

I want to go to the book store and pick up some reading for the plane, my
laptop won't last for the flight and I may not be able to use it anyway.  

I have also been meaning to take my little laptop to the office and update to
a current build of Solaris 10, install frkit and grab an old wireless card. It
looks like that isn't going to happen.
