From the ~180 questions the end result was a field of 58. I Passed! I am  
curious to know how I did on the full spread. Things that could have gone  
better: Printing (So not a surprise) Software Installs File systems High  
points: Security Booting and Shutting Down Backups and Restores It is a  
shame that you don't get immediate feedback on Beta exams, I might have  
better remembered the things that I thought were problematic aside from  
the general printing kicked my butt. Part 2 will be the real question, it  
was much more Solaris 10 specific, or rather there are a lot of things  
that had different ways of being done before Solaris 10. It is however  
suggested that Sun Edu. Services would be more than willing to help me out  
on the weaker aspects.
