Bob Sneed  

The problem is probably due to what such problems are usually due to.  

For the large part...beleives root cause analysis is a waste of time and
money.  

Recommends Patterns and Anti patterns books.  

**AntiPatterns** (Stuff we know doesn't work)  

Description  
  
Symptom  
  
Consequences  
  
How to fix it  

Collecting Data  

No data  

Configuraiton  
  
Appdata  
  
Irrelevant  

Mountains of Data  

"Climb Every Mountain" -- Irrational Change Control Enforcement  

"Monkey in the Middle" -- Uncooperative party between customer and 'right
answer'  

"Dueling Engagement Models"  

More than I can succinctly and usefully indicate  

The customer is not always right! _(but we knew that)_  

The customer should know what is going on but the customer dictating what they
think the problem  

Translations  

Customer will not give us requested data  

"We do not have a good relationship"  

"The customer will not follow our advice"  

no good trust relationship  

"customer will not cooperate, we've doone all we can do!"  

work on soft skills  

Summary: work on the relationship  

Technical Antipatterns  

Problems on EOL  
  
_(more I can't condense quickly)

Data Collection  

Start with business problem  
  
Check for bogus problem  
  
Check config  
  
Check resource  

Who the Heck was William Dawes?  

See Harvard Business Review 12/2005  

Bob made a slide using his kids to discuss bug processing/submission.  

Pass the Ball or Carry it?  

Refferal  

when, how to whom  

Collab  

when how with whom  

Experts look for two things:  

patterns: things you have seen before  

can be a slide or a white-paper  

things you have **not** seen before  

no substitute for expertise  

Bob's take:  

Lowest cost sollution -- apply expert early (and often but only for new
issues)  

Define solution pass to assistant  

Think Doctor and Physicians Assistant  

A problem that can be understood can be addressed by the PA  

Get an expert negotiator to convince a customer that "thing" has to happen,
the 400K$ in lab work is not required to debug a simple config problem on a
1M$ system.
