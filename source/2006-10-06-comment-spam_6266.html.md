I am getting annoyed by comment spam.  
  
It had been a problem, then everything was working well again, now it  
appears that the spambots are able to recognize our challenge and do  
simple math.  
  
I also know that the spam is not personal...but really. Spamming a post  
about my wife's brother being shot by a sniper in Iraq, so not cool.
