Has it always been Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment?  
Why isn't it DCTE  
then?

DTE - Data Terminal Equipment DCE - Data Communication Equipment Is  
DTE really Data Terminal-Terminating Equipment?

I think I can see a way  
that Data Communication/Terminal Equipment could have become that DCTE  
garbage. An exhaustive primairy source (google) search shows that the  
expanded [  
DCE "data communication
equipment"](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22data+communication+equipment%22)
has ~30K results.  
While my  
new favorite [  
DCTE "data circuit-terminating
equipment"](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22data+communication-
terminal+equipment%22) has 54 results.

The  
real questions here are why am I reading "Essential Guide to  
Telecommunications, Second Edition, The" and "Absolute Beginner's Guide to  
Networking, Third Edition" and haven't I already proven to myself that I  
get much less frustrated when I just don't do the assigned reading?

This  
is what I get for playing with computers instead of attending classes  
during my first go at college, well this and a pile of student loans that  
took a few years to pay off.
