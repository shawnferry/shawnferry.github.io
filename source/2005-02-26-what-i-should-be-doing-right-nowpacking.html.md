  1.   
Staging the contents of the Attic into the living room so we can move.

  2. " " Basement Closets " "  

  3. " " Laundry Room/Computer Closet/Work Room   
" "  

  4. Break down rack leaving only the FW and enough gear to run this   
house until the new house is live on Tuesday.  

  5. Break down the old HUGE   
UPS in the Laundry Room/Computer Closet into "3 man carry" portable bits  
so the movers can get it out of the house.(Free isn't always good)

What I  
want to be doing right now...

  1. Rebuilding my Solaris 10 box with a   
failed Hard drive and upgrading to GA  

    1. Rebuilding my FW to scavenge the   
SCSI card so I can access both sides of my old HP NetStore JBOD(see 1).  

    2. Checking out this bfu thing and trying out Janus and ZFS although I am   
not really sure how bfu works.

  2. Continue working my way through the   
Dtrace manual (which depends on 1)  

  3. Get [  
Torrus](http://www.torrus.org) running on my Solaris 10 box and use Dtrace to
look at the  
internals(see 1).  

  4. In conjunction with 3 play with slamd, ctrun and   
smf(see 1).  

  5. Trying to not electrocute myself while isolating the short   
in my APC3000, and Figuring out if the APC2200 I have destroyed the last  
set of batteries or if the batteries were  

  6. bad to begin with(Auctions Can   
be Bad, cheap junk is still junk).

  7. Most anything other than packing.   

What I could be doing right now that would sort of qualify for both...but  
not really

  1. Figuring out if the APC Trade-UPS program where they come   
and take away your old ups would include the removal of the behemoth not  
that I can really afford to buy 6KVA of new hardware to qualify even with  
the discount.

What I am doing right now...

  1. Playing [  
Metaphysik: Ball Revamped II by John
Cooney](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/metaphysik.php) a silly flash
game that now I  
feel the need to play again for better results.

  2. Reading [  
Sun Blogs](blogs.sun.com)

  3. Wasting time posting to this blog :)
