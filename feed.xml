    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can now put my fingers through the sides of both of my NorthFace
Singletracks, the duct tape in the left heel is working out well and I didn't
get a blister where the heel cup had started pressing and the liner is wearing
out. The soles and midsole seem fine but the rest of the shoes have seen
better days after 350 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday Saucony came out to =PR= in Leesburg and had their &lt;a href="http://www.saucony.com/store/SiteController/saucony/productdetails;jsessionid=EEED20FF3A8DD512371608E9A9B25AF6
.pss-
app-08-app3?stockNumber=20098-1&amp;amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;amp;skuId=***4********20098-1*M085&amp;amp;productId=4-105710&amp;amp;catId=cat1960407"&gt;Men's ProGrid
Peregrine&lt;/a&gt;
available. I really liked how light they were and the grip felt good on the
moderate terrain near Leesburg. The cushioning seemed somewhat minimal but
sufficient (two days post a foot pounding 50k). The minimal drop seemed fine.
If they had a wider toe box I would have bought a pair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday Adidas came out to =PR= Ashburn and brought out a something zero, I
don't think it is released yet. It it was super light and felt cool and
breezy. The cushioning was not quiet enough for me and as is the trend the toe
box was narrow even having gone up a size to get it wide enough for my foot in
general.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Gunpowder 50K was the inaugural event with this course and name in
Gunpowder Falls State Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An out and back course starting at the &lt;a href="http://thegunpowderlodge.com/"&gt;Gunpowder
Lodge&lt;/a&gt; running through Gunpowder State Park the
race description "The Gunpowder trail provides various challenges ranging from
rocky terrain, continuous climbs and questionable blazes." I only had problems
at the turn around where I couldn't see the aid station and about 6 miles from
the finish where I was lined up just right to not be able to see the next
blaze or bit of marking tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos.shawnferry.com/Running/gunpowder50k-2010/SPF20101120IMG4716/1102372622_VU6sQ-M.jpg" alt="I took a few photos during the run
" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos.shawnferry.com/Running/gunpowder50k-2010/14782950_mQyMz" title="A few photos from the course"&gt;A few photos from the
course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an attractive course but apparently the leaves just fell in recent rain
covering the otherwise very visible trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race went fairly well for me. I finished 50 minutes faster than my last
50k but started having some discomfort with my left knee around mile 12. On
the return I ran for a while chatting with some mountain bikers thinking that
we must be crazy to be running 30+ miles. It felt to me like it was turning
into a race for last and for the first time ever in a long race I actually
tried to race instead of finish or just better my previous results. I pushed
to get back over the hills to the rock scrambles and corners to stay out of
sight but it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out I was feeling generally fine except for the nagging pain in my
knee which turned into an inability to effectively run downhill. With maybe
six miles to go I had difficulty finding the course and stopped for a minute
looking for blazes while doing that my ITB tightened up. I started hobbling to
the end and on the way my ITB loosened allowing me to run on and off but never
got back to the point where I was running comfortably. At the 4ish mile aid
station I stopped to write in my time and the delay had me hobbling out the
other side on a horse trail. Steve pulled up and asked if I was okay and I
jokingly allowed with a grin that I might drop at the next aid station (the
finish). At 2-3 miles he was waiting at the last road crossing to pull up the
signs asking if I needed anything (maybe I looked really bad the last time he
saw me?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With about 2 miles left I realized I was close to shaving an hour off my last
50k. Fortunately the last bits were mostly flat. Unfortunately this is also
where I tripped on a root onto a nice truly soft bit of trail, I rolled
through the fall and kept running but noticed that I needed to finish the last
however long in 30s and I still couldn't see the finish. I backed off to a
hard but runnable (for some values of running) pace. I got to the line DFL to
cheers from finished runners at the outside tables and the crowd still at the
line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I really noticed any ITB tightness/pain and I
attribute it to the heavy racing/training schedule at the end of the year. I'm
still recovering a bit with a foam roller stretches and massage and think I am
managing the recovery nicely so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(On Slacking, this was written December 27th 2010, not sure why I never hit
publish. Good job on that)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MCM Race Report or An Example of Poor Execution</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marine Corps was my target race this year after making the questionable
decision to run Baltimore (as a last overly long taper) two weeks before. I
had been hoping to cut another 30 minutes off my marathon to break 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story is that while I think my training was generally on target my
execution failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got out of the house about 10 minutes later than I had been aiming for but
still with what I expected to be plenty of time to spare. Parking was fine and
it took 5-10 minutes to park and make it to Court House Metro. Just as I was
passing through the gate I heard a train depart. I was expecting trains to be
running on rush hour schedule unfortunately the next train to Rosslyn was show
as being 15 minutes, from Rosslyn to Pentagon the trains were about 6 minutes
apart and the wait was about 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Pentagon to the start is ~1.75 mi. I had a bag to check, 12 minutes
to the start and I could use a trip to the can. Instead of trying to run to
the bag check and start I decided to remain calm and make my best progress
without going crazy. I got to the bag check just before 8am and with expected
punctuality the race started. I was still about a mile from the start and
could still use the toilet and I decided to spend the time before crossing the
start instead of with my race clock running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides of 110 go to the starting line and the south bound lane appeared to
have substantially fewer people. I crossed over and made my way up passing
pace groups in the NB lane down to around (hand carried) signs for the 4:15
group before the field got too crowded to move further forward, after crossing
the line the crowds remained tight. Even planning for a couple of slow miles
with the crowds and early hills I still found myself getting frustrated after
the second mile when I had trouble making good lines and the throngs of people
seemed to be composed mainly of interlocking waves intent on randomly and
dramatically changing pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mile 5 was almost on pace, Mile 6 with the last real climb was about the pace
I expected. Mile 7, a descent, was faster than planned while Mile 8 was again
crowded, 9 and 10 were a few seconds behind and ahead respectively but having
run the Army 10 Miler helped a bit here with lane selection around
construction near the Kennedy Center. Mile 12/13 slowed as the roads narrowed
getting onto Hains Point. I also paused for ~15s to stretch as my left glute
and hamstring were starting to get tight.&lt;br /&gt;
I made the half at 2:04 and realized that given how I was feeling, the crowds
etc that there was no way I was going to take 5 minutes off my half marathon
PR to make a sub 4 finish. Around Mile 19 I gave up on a big improvement on my
PR and decided I was just going to run it in at a relatively easy 10min or so
pace thinking that if I could get space and get moving I could hopefully take
off a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;
Climbing onto the 14th street bridge and back into the wind I stopped to
stretch a couple more times around 20.5 with wide roads I died a little inside
and just decided that finishing was generally the new goal. I did eventually
finish in 4:47:38, it was clearly not the result I was hoping for but I
learned from this race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately post race the finish chute was very crowded and slow but getting
the medals and water went smoothly and fairly quickly. However, trying to get
out to the finish festival the crowd was very slow so I stopped and stretched
a bit, took stock drank a bit more water and decided to move on. At this point
there were further delays and on standing back up but not being able to really
move around my calves and hamstrings started to cramp. I walked myself over to
the medical tent to get checked out the staff was quite helpful and I quickly
got a tylenol and some ice bags to chill my legs. Twenty or thirty minutes
later I got up and headed for baggage check collected my things and walked two
mostly uphill miles to my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;
Take Aways **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had water at every aid. I didn't have any real stomach issues but I was dehydrated at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ran with a hydration pack but drank only half of what I was carrying. I need to go back to wearing a second watch with an interval timer to remind me to drink.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was worried about being cold at the start so I didn't want to allow too much extra time, instead I was late (Crossed the line at 8:13).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The large races are fun but I don't necessarily like crowds and the crowded course was frustrating. It was a good experience but I may not run it again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waiting in line 30s for a port-a-jon before crossing the start was making the best of a bad situation. Already being late two more minutes here didn't make that much more of a difference in the crowd density on the road, probably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got home we had our traditional halloween gathering with a nice fire
and chili, this years turn out was not as good as previous years it seems that
cool weather and a Sunday are not the most conducive for halloween parties or
trick or treat volume.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friday the 23rd of October was our 5th wedding anniversary, since we were
planning on staying in the city overnight I packed to run in the morning.
Shortly before we left the house I got a last minute opportunity to run the
Army 10 Miler which I accepted. That evening the Caps defeated the Thrashers 4
to 3, we went to the Irish Channel Pub stayed had a late dinner and drinks
made our way back to the hotel and eventually got to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief sleep a convenient but uneventful metro ride to the start I got
a bib, dropped off my bag and headed to the start. This is the largest race I
have ever run and the mass of people was impressive. As a last longer taper
run before Marine Corps I tried to keep my pace to a very easy recovery pace
and note the parts of the course that coincide with MCM, in particular the
14th street bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the easy run noticing a bit of heaviness in my legs, a bit of a
hangover and felt the lack of sleep. For the last few miles starting on the
14th street bridge I began increasing the pace picking up slowly to my goal
marathon pace for the last mile and a half or so. The pace felt OK, the effort
seemed to be about what I was expecting for that point in the race. I finished
in 1:43:38 a reasonable but unchallenging result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm still going to write up my notes from MCM and Army 10 Miler but until I do
I'm trying to not fall too far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up early to head to the trail and get in a few hours of easy running to
shake out my legs before the Turkey Run aid station opened. I was getting
antsy to run after going from full on training to racing for three weeks to
recovery from MCM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an exciting descent down the small cliff to the PHT via not the actual
trail I got in another 8 miles and felt good. Shortly after 10 while I was
changing my clothes the first runner came through shortly after that I started
taking pictures. It was a good time and the after party was also very fun. I
met a bunch of new people who's names I have mostly forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
