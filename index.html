  <p>I can now put my fingers through the sides of both of my NorthFace
Singletracks, the duct tape in the left heel is working out well and I didn't
get a blister where the heel cup had started pressing and the liner is wearing
out. The soles and midsole seem fine but the rest of the shoes have seen
better days after 350 miles.</p>

<p>On Monday Saucony came out to =PR= in Leesburg and had their <a href="http://www.saucony.com/store/SiteController/saucony/productdetails;jsessionid=EEED20FF3A8DD512371608E9A9B25AF6

available. I really liked how light they were and the grip felt good on the
moderate terrain near Leesburg. The cushioning seemed somewhat minimal but
sufficient (two days post a foot pounding 50k). The minimal drop seemed fine.
If they had a wider toe box I would have bought a pair</p>

<p>On Tuesday Adidas came out to =PR= Ashburn and brought out a something zero, I
don't think it is released yet. It it was super light and felt cool and
breezy. The cushioning was not quiet enough for me and as is the trend the toe
box was narrow even having gone up a size to get it wide enough for my foot in
general.</p>

  <p>The Gunpowder 50K was the inaugural event with this course and name in
Gunpowder Falls State Park.</p>

<p>An out and back course starting at the <a href="http://thegunpowderlodge.com/">Gunpowder
Lodge</a> running through Gunpowder State Park the
race description "The Gunpowder trail provides various challenges ranging from
rocky terrain, continuous climbs and questionable blazes." I only had problems
at the turn around where I couldn't see the aid station and about 6 miles from
the finish where I was lined up just right to not be able to see the next
blaze or bit of marking tape.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos.shawnferry.com/Running/gunpowder50k-2010/SPF20101120IMG4716/1102372622_VU6sQ-M.jpg" alt="I took a few photos during the run

course</a></p>

<p>It was an attractive course but apparently the leaves just fell in recent rain
covering the otherwise very visible trail.</p>

<p>The race went fairly well for me. I finished 50 minutes faster than my last
50k but started having some discomfort with my left knee around mile 12. On
the return I ran for a while chatting with some mountain bikers thinking that
we must be crazy to be running 30+ miles. It felt to me like it was turning
into a race for last and for the first time ever in a long race I actually
tried to race instead of finish or just better my previous results. I pushed
to get back over the hills to the rock scrambles and corners to stay out of
sight but it didn't work.</p>

<p>As it turns out I was feeling generally fine except for the nagging pain in my
knee which turned into an inability to effectively run downhill. With maybe
six miles to go I had difficulty finding the course and stopped for a minute
looking for blazes while doing that my ITB tightened up. I started hobbling to
the end and on the way my ITB loosened allowing me to run on and off but never
got back to the point where I was running comfortably. At the 4ish mile aid
station I stopped to write in my time and the delay had me hobbling out the
other side on a horse trail. Steve pulled up and asked if I was okay and I
jokingly allowed with a grin that I might drop at the next aid station (the
finish). At 2-3 miles he was waiting at the last road crossing to pull up the
signs asking if I needed anything (maybe I looked really bad the last time he
saw me?).</p>

<p>With about 2 miles left I realized I was close to shaving an hour off my last
50k. Fortunately the last bits were mostly flat. Unfortunately this is also
where I tripped on a root onto a nice truly soft bit of trail, I rolled
through the fall and kept running but noticed that I needed to finish the last
however long in 30s and I still couldn't see the finish. I backed off to a
hard but runnable (for some values of running) pace. I got to the line DFL to
cheers from finished runners at the outside tables and the crowd still at the
line.</p>

<p>This was the first time I really noticed any ITB tightness/pain and I
attribute it to the heavy racing/training schedule at the end of the year. I'm
still recovering a bit with a foam roller stretches and massage and think I am
managing the recovery nicely so far.</p>

<p>(On Slacking, this was written December 27th 2010, not sure why I never hit
publish. Good job on that)</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Marine Corps was my target race this year after making the questionable
decision to run Baltimore (as a last overly long taper) two weeks before. I
had been hoping to cut another 30 minutes off my marathon to break 4 hours.</p>

<p>The short story is that while I think my training was generally on target my
execution failed.</p>

<p>I got out of the house about 10 minutes later than I had been aiming for but
still with what I expected to be plenty of time to spare. Parking was fine and
it took 5-10 minutes to park and make it to Court House Metro. Just as I was
passing through the gate I heard a train depart. I was expecting trains to be
running on rush hour schedule unfortunately the next train to Rosslyn was show
as being 15 minutes, from Rosslyn to Pentagon the trains were about 6 minutes
apart and the wait was about 4 minutes.</p>

<p>From the Pentagon to the start is ~1.75 mi. I had a bag to check, 12 minutes
to the start and I could use a trip to the can. Instead of trying to run to
the bag check and start I decided to remain calm and make my best progress
without going crazy. I got to the bag check just before 8am and with expected
punctuality the race started. I was still about a mile from the start and
could still use the toilet and I decided to spend the time before crossing the
start instead of with my race clock running.</p>

<p>Both sides of 110 go to the starting line and the south bound lane appeared to
have substantially fewer people. I crossed over and made my way up passing
pace groups in the NB lane down to around (hand carried) signs for the 4:15
group before the field got too crowded to move further forward, after crossing
the line the crowds remained tight. Even planning for a couple of slow miles
with the crowds and early hills I still found myself getting frustrated after
the second mile when I had trouble making good lines and the throngs of people
seemed to be composed mainly of interlocking waves intent on randomly and
dramatically changing pace.</p>

<p>Mile 5 was almost on pace, Mile 6 with the last real climb was about the pace
I expected. Mile 7, a descent, was faster than planned while Mile 8 was again
crowded, 9 and 10 were a few seconds behind and ahead respectively but having
run the Army 10 Miler helped a bit here with lane selection around
construction near the Kennedy Center. Mile 12/13 slowed as the roads narrowed
getting onto Hains Point. I also paused for ~15s to stretch as my left glute
and hamstring were starting to get tight.<br />
I made the half at 2:04 and realized that given how I was feeling, the crowds
etc that there was no way I was going to take 5 minutes off my half marathon
PR to make a sub 4 finish. Around Mile 19 I gave up on a big improvement on my
PR and decided I was just going to run it in at a relatively easy 10min or so
pace thinking that if I could get space and get moving I could hopefully take
off a minute or two.<br />
Climbing onto the 14th street bridge and back into the wind I stopped to
stretch a couple more times around 20.5 with wide roads I died a little inside
and just decided that finishing was generally the new goal. I did eventually
finish in 4:47:38, it was clearly not the result I was hoping for but I
learned from this race.</p>

<p>Immediately post race the finish chute was very crowded and slow but getting
the medals and water went smoothly and fairly quickly. However, trying to get
out to the finish festival the crowd was very slow so I stopped and stretched
a bit, took stock drank a bit more water and decided to move on. At this point
there were further delays and on standing back up but not being able to really
move around my calves and hamstrings started to cramp. I walked myself over to
the medical tent to get checked out the staff was quite helpful and I quickly
got a tylenol and some ice bags to chill my legs. Twenty or thirty minutes
later I got up and headed for baggage check collected my things and walked two
mostly uphill miles to my car.</p>

<p>**<br />
Take Aways **</p>

<ul>
  <li>I had water at every aid. I didn't have any real stomach issues but I was dehydrated at the end.</li>
  <li>I ran with a hydration pack but drank only half of what I was carrying. I need to go back to wearing a second watch with an interval timer to remind me to drink.</li>
  <li>I was worried about being cold at the start so I didn't want to allow too much extra time, instead I was late (Crossed the line at 8:13).</li>
  <li>The large races are fun but I don't necessarily like crowds and the crowded course was frustrating. It was a good experience but I may not run it again.</li>
  <li>Waiting in line 30s for a port-a-jon before crossing the start was making the best of a bad situation. Already being late two more minutes here didn't make that much more of a difference in the crowd density on the road, probably.</li>
</ul>

<p>After I got home we had our traditional halloween gathering with a nice fire
and chili, this years turn out was not as good as previous years it seems that
cool weather and a Sunday are not the most conducive for halloween parties or
trick or treat volume.</p>

  <p>Friday the 23rd of October was our 5th wedding anniversary, since we were
planning on staying in the city overnight I packed to run in the morning.
Shortly before we left the house I got a last minute opportunity to run the
Army 10 Miler which I accepted. That evening the Caps defeated the Thrashers 4
to 3, we went to the Irish Channel Pub stayed had a late dinner and drinks
made our way back to the hotel and eventually got to sleep.</p>

<p>After a brief sleep a convenient but uneventful metro ride to the start I got
a bib, dropped off my bag and headed to the start. This is the largest race I
have ever run and the mass of people was impressive. As a last longer taper
run before Marine Corps I tried to keep my pace to a very easy recovery pace
and note the parts of the course that coincide with MCM, in particular the
14th street bridge.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the easy run noticing a bit of heaviness in my legs, a bit of a
hangover and felt the lack of sleep. For the last few miles starting on the
14th street bridge I began increasing the pace picking up slowly to my goal
marathon pace for the last mile and a half or so. The pace felt OK, the effort
seemed to be about what I was expecting for that point in the race. I finished
in 1:43:38 a reasonable but unchallenging result.</p>

  <p>I'm still going to write up my notes from MCM and Army 10 Miler but until I do
I'm trying to not fall too far behind.</p>

<p>I got up early to head to the trail and get in a few hours of easy running to
shake out my legs before the Turkey Run aid station opened. I was getting
antsy to run after going from full on training to racing for three weeks to
recovery from MCM.</p>

<p>After an exciting descent down the small cliff to the PHT via not the actual
trail I got in another 8 miles and felt good. Shortly after 10 while I was
changing my clothes the first runner came through shortly after that I started
taking pictures. It was a good time and the after party was also very fun. I
met a bunch of new people who's names I have mostly forgotten.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/10/21/10th-baltimore-marathon-race-report.html">10th Baltimore Marathon Race Report</a> <span>Oct 21</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>An abject lesson in not trying something new for a race, even if it supposed
to be a fun run.</p>

<p>This was my third time running Baltimore only this year it was an excessively
long training run for Marine Corps. I went into the race this year planning on
running around a 4:30 or a bit slower than my current marathon PR and my
current easy/long training pace. Expecting it to be a long and possibly
difficult but not really challenging run I planned to allow for up to a 4:25
finish (and a possibly PR). I had been calling this a fun run in my head for
weeks to make sure I wasn't thinking in the back of my head that I was out to
really push myself and dig in and compromise my MCM performance.</p>

<p>I was looking for the 4:30 pace group to make sure I wasn't going out too fast
or maintaining an overly high pace. I was slightly late and behind at the
start and crammed in around the edge of the field they pace group got off into
the distance and disappeared. The first ~3.5 miles of the course is generally
a slow easy climb it felt easy but I was bottled up instead of weaving and
dodging I picked good gaps and took it easy. The weather was phenomenal a bit
chilly at the start but once we were moving it was great if a bit windy.
Around Druid Hill park/Mile 4 I started running with Debora? and Ken? they
were both running their first marathons and it was good to chat.</p>

<p>Part of treating this as training and not a goal race was trying something
new, clearly there are no downsides to this plan. I have been running with a
Nathan HPL 20 and Hammer Perpetum previously and for all my other marathons I
ran with a fuel belt and concentrated fuel. This time I decided to try a SPI
belt and very concentrated fuel relying on the water stops for all my water. I
was very consciously taking water at every aid station the SPI belt was a
little bouncy in my lower back but not a problem. In the end this was a
horrible failure.</p>

<p>Around mile 9 I started to feel a bit off and stopped putting in food but kept
drinking water and taking endurolytes every hour. I just figured that I was
taking too much fuel due to the concentration and I needed to dilute and let
my stomach clear I wasn't sloshing but I just felt full. The discomfort
continued to increase but otherwise I continued to feel fine. Around mile 12
we caught up with the 4:30 pace group and slowly passed them running a still
very comfortable average at 10:07. Around mile 17 Ken paced himself back to us
and around 17.5 I told them I needed to take a pit stop and would hopefully
catch up over the next few miles. At the mile 18 water stop I had a
frustrating bathroom visit producing nothing and wasted three minutes for the
rest of the run I would have some occasional gas and feel a bit better for it.</p>

<p>On the way to the lake I called C- looking for moral support, she told me that
this was only a training run for MCM and I could drop if I wanted and she
would make it to the wedding early for posed pictures (all of which is what I
needed to hear). I thought seriously about dropping or vomiting at the 3rd
relay leg but recalled someone saying they could have jogged to the end faster
than the bus which got stuck in traffic last year and decided to stick it out.</p>

<p>At Lake Motebello Aid I had 1/2 bananna and stopped to get some petroleum
jelly for chafing, temps and wind resulted in lack of liquid sweat on skin and
I think I lost some lube on my throw away pants. While I was getting extra
lube I realized that medical might have an anti-gas, they had generic Maylox
with simethicone which is exactly what I was looking for. Around the end of
the lake I picked up someone's discarded shirt and put it on, feeling a little
chilled I guess from the lower pace or in retrospect maybe dehydration. The
last hills and the finish weren't much to mention I slowly began to feel a
little better and chatted with and encouraged some runners but I was so in the
hole for hydration and nutrition there wasn't any time to recover on the move.</p>

<p>After I collected my bag, drank my recoverite, tried to piss before heading to
the car, saw an orange on the ground and decided I really wanted an orange, it
was cold juicy and wonderful. I slowly made my way back to the car dumped a
gallon of water over my head and scrubbed my pits to rinse off as I wasn't
likely to have time to shower before the wedding started. As I was parking I
saw the bride walking in and made my best speed changing into emergency
clothes from the trunk. Wedding was great, good food and friends. I was tired
but not ready to sleep when I got home. Up hydrating and chatting until about
1am with friends who were in town for the wedding. Didn't want to sleep until
I had to urinate which took a glass of wine, two glasses of champagne, one
beer, 100oz of water and almost 12 hours. Slept in late the next day it was
wonderful.</p>

<p>Walked on Sunday and Monday to shake things out and now I feel fully
recovered.</p>

<p>How this compares to last year:</p>

<p>Baltimore 5:20 (3rd Marathon, 2nd of 2009, with low grade fever), Space Coast
4:26:55 (4th Marathon, 3rd of 2009, PR) We will see if a horrible Baltimore
always makes for a good next race.</p>

<p>Doing the math I took in all of ~300 Calories in the first 2 hours. I would
normally do closer to 600. At MCM I'm going back to the Nathan and saying damn
the extra ~4 lbs in water weight.</p>

<p>I'll see you next year at Baltimore, I managed to win an entry. Baltimore 2011
is goal race; I'll be the one going faster and finishing stronger than I have
before.</p>

  <p>Managed to start this entry and never post it. I do that sometimes… 25 days
ago</p>

<p>Carried CamelBak Rim Runner which I think is about 10 years old, it didn't
disintegrate in the closet. Weather was beautiful company was good. Attempt to
patch smaller Hydrapack was a failure so C- got wet.</p>

<p>Pleased with the North Face Singletrack although with a loaded pack I think I
would want a bit more height for ankle support (maybe).</p>

<p>We did end up taking almost 6 hours to do 12.5 miles but the fluid needs were
lower than expected (e.g. not 100oz in 3 hours of relatively easy hiking in
nice weather). Food Choices were correct in volume 2 PB&amp;Js each and I also
had a Hammer Bar early in.</p>

<p>Saw a bunch of people running, chatted with one on an uphill section, she was
pre-running the trail part of the JFK 50. Yet again I have more respect for
people doing ultras on more technical terrain. For some reason that doesn't
stop me from wanting to do them.</p>

  <p>I spent the last few hours reading ultra running blogs starting with the race
report for the Burning Man 50k with ice packs on my right foot.</p>

<p>I think it started last Saturday when I ran 23 miles. I was tired at the end
but found myself running on and off with a big grin. Finished up, went grocery
shopping with C- and home to clean up for <a href="http://photos.shawnferry.com/Weddings/Mike-and-
Mindy/13747795_fGc93#1005594000_9ztxs">Mike and Mindy's
Reception</a>. I wore my new Vivo Barefoot shoes they
were comfortable but felt a little tight over the arch of my right foot.</p>

<p>Sunday I ran an easy 6mi felt a little tired from the run and late night, my
foot hurt a little but not horribly. Monday I played hockey for only the
second time in the season and my feet started to cramp a little at the end if
the first period (I wear my skates a full size smaller than my shoes). Did an
easy 7mi on Tuesday did goal pace mile repeats on Thursday.<br />
Saturday I was supposed to run 18 with 8 or so at race pace instead I was
exhausted and have taken the weekend off.</p>

<p>I thinking I will walk over to pick up some prescriptions and back just so I
do something today. Hockey game at 9:15 I'm undecided. Should I rest what is
probably tendonitits or should I play I want to run both races but if I go
into Baltimore with a nagging injury doing well at MCM is probably off the
table.</p>

<p>27 days to 10th Baltimore Marathon<br />
41 days to 35th Marine Marathon</p>
